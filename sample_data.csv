Trump, when Mr. Trump was accused of withholding military aid from Ukraine in an effort to persuade President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration to investigate Hunter Biden.Mr. Lutsenko, an opposition party member who now serves as a military officer, emerged from the impeachment trial in 2019 a tainted figure in Ukraine. As the prosecutor general under Mr. Zelensky’s predecessor, Mr. Lutsenko had met with Mr. Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and had discussed starting an investigation of Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son.So when Mr. Lutsenko received a military promotion last month, it raised some eyebrows in Kyiv. Some saw it as a tone-deaf provocation of the Biden administration, sure to irritate Mr. Zelensky’s aides at a time when the Ukrainian Army is deeply dependent on military aid from the United States.Then last week, Mr. Lutsenko abruptly lost his new assignment as the commander of a platoon of drone operators near the embattled city of Bakhmut. That prompted accusations of political retribution and raised the possibility of friction not just between Ukraine’s political parties, but between Mr. Zelensky and his military leadership as well.Mr. Lutsenko himself was quick to float the possibility that Mr. Zelensky’s office had meddled with his promotion because of his position in the opposition party. “This little political revenge will not make Ukraine stronger,” Mr. Lutsenko wrote on Facebook after he was stripped of his command. “It’s high time to work on unity.”Mr. Zelensky’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Lutsenko’s military appointments.Fellow soldiers have rallied to Mr. Lutsenko’s defense, arguing that whatever his role in political squabbles in Ukraine in the past, he has redeemed himself by fighting on one of the most dangerous sections of the front line.Ukraine’s raucous politics have been largely put on hold during the war. Opposition politicians have rallied behind Mr. Zelensky as commander in chief, even if they quietly criticize some of his policies. Many politicians, from both pro-government and opposition parties, volunteered to fight in the Ukrainian Army.Mr. Lutsenko is a member of European Solidarity, a party led by Mr. Zelensky’s chief opponent in the 2019 presidential elections, former President Petro O. Poroshenko.Before the war, Mr. Zelensky had drawn criticism for seeming to hold a grudge against Mr. Poroshenko, even after defeating him in the election. Their rivalry had dominated Ukrainian politics.Volodymyr Ariev, a European Solidarity member of Parliament, said in a telephone interview that the reversal of Mr. Lutsenko’s military promotion “gravely concerns” him. “It’s clearly a politically motivated decision,” he said.Before Mr. Trump’s interest in having Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden became public, Mr. Lutsenko, then serving as prosecutor general under Mr. Poroshenko, had met with Mr. Giuliani and discussed an investigation of Hunter Biden.In testimony that emerged in the impeachment trial, Mr. Lutsenko was cast as a supporter of Mr. Giuliani’s plan, which Democrats said was intended to help Mr. Trump in the 2020 election. Mr. Lutsenko has said that he met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss other law enforcement issues and had declined to investigate Hunter Biden."

Trump, announced Tuesday that he would be leaving Congress in June.Mr. Cicilline, 61, will become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, the state’s largest funder of nonprofit organizations.In a statement, Mr. Cicilline called the job offer “unexpected” but one he felt he could not turn down.“It is an extraordinary opportunity to have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state,” he said. “The same energy and commitment I brought to elected office, I will now bring as CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, advancing their mission to ensure all Rhode Islanders can achieve economic security; access quality, affordable health care; and attain the education and training that will set them on a path to prosperity.”In his seventh term in Congress, Mr. Cicilline is a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees. He is also a member of the Democratic leadership.He will remain in office until June 1, and his staff will continue to assist constituents until a new member is elected to finish the remainder of the two-year term.In 2019, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Cicilline worked to investigate Mr. Trump during House Democrats’ first impeachment effort. He took on a larger role as an impeachment manager in Mr. Trump’s second trial after a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, 2021.“Since his resounding defeat in the presidential election in November, Donald Trump has done everything but concede to the democratic will of the American people,” Mr. Cicilline wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times published ahead of the impeachment trial.He added: “We cannot let this go unanswered. With each day, Mr. Trump grows more and more desperate. We should not allow him to menace the security of our country for a second longer.”Mr. Cicilline also led a subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law. In his work on antitrust law, he oversaw what experts described as among the most serious congressional inquiries into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades, focusing on some of the country’s most powerful tech companies, including Amazon, Google and Facebook.Before joining Congress, Mr. Cicilline worked as a public defender in Washington and served two terms as the mayor of Providence, R.I., where he was the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called Mr. Cicilline an “effective and thoughtful legislator” and a “close friend.”“David has been a leading advocate for L.G.B.T.Q. Americans in the fight for full equality under the law, and he has led House Democrats in our efforts to get weapons of war off of our streets to end the gun violence epidemic once and for all,” he said. “He has been a dedicated defender of our democracy.”Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of the progressive group Public Citizen, said in a statement that Mr. Cicilline “will leave behind a substantial and meaningful legacy in Congress — from reinvigorating antitrust policy, to helping to lead the charge for progressive regulatory policy reform, to spearheading landmark anti-discrimination legislation for the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community.”“He will be sorely missed,” she added."
2,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/opinion/trump-mueller-ukraine-jan-6.html,"In retrospect, the Mueller report was a cry for help.“The office,” as the special counsel so self-effacingly called itself in its report, knew its limits, or at least chose them. It could not indict a sitting president. It was generous with the benefit of the doubt when evaluating a potential “obstructive act” or gauging criminal intent by President Donald Trump. It considered mitigating, and sometimes dubious, explanations for his behavior, and was as restrained in interpreting the president’s misdeeds as it was zealous in listing them.Its conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice became a Washington classic of needle-threading ambiguity: “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” The office declined to call Trump a criminal, however much it might have wanted to.Instead, scattered throughout its 448 pages, the Mueller report includes some not-so-subtle instructions and warnings that future investigators, less inhibited, could heed when facing fresh misdeeds.The two highest-profile congressional investigations of Trump that followed — the 2019 report by the House Intelligence Committee on Trump’s pressuring of Ukraine as well as the recently released report by the select committee on the Jan. 6 attack — read like deliberate contrasts to the document produced by Robert Mueller and his team. Their presentation is dramatic, not dense; their conclusions are blunt, not oblique; their arguments are political as much as legal. And yet, the Ukraine and Jan. 6 reports seem to follow the cues, explicit or implied, that the Mueller report left behind.Read together, these three major investigations of the Trump presidency appear in conversation with one another, ever more detailed drafts of a most unorthodox historical record — a history in which these documents are characters as much as chroniclers.The documents try to explain the former president, and they also strain to contain him. The Mueller report inspects the guardrails that Trump bent and sometimes broke. The Ukraine report lays out the case that led to his first impeachment. The Jan. 6 report now declares him “unfit” to return to the nation’s highest office — the very office Trump is again pursuing — or to any office below it.The effect is cumulative. While the Mueller report evaluates Trump’s behavior as a series of individual, unrelated actions, it knows better, stating near the end that the president’s “pattern of conduct as a whole” was vital to grasping his intentions. The Ukraine and Jan. 6 reports took up that task, establishing links among Trump’s varied transgressions.While the Mueller report wonders whether Trump and his advisers committed certain acts “willfully” — that is, “with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct” — the investigations into his strong-arming of Ukraine and the Capitol assault seek to show that Trump knew that his actions violated the law and that his statements ran counter to the truth.And while the Mueller report grudgingly posits that some of the president’s questionable actions might have been taken with the public, rather than the private, interest in mind, the Ukraine and Jan. 6 reports contend that with Trump, the distinction between public and private always collapsed in favor of the latter.The Mueller report would not declare that the president deserved impeachment or had committed crimes, but it didn’t mind if someone else reached those conclusions. It states plainly that accusing Trump of a crime could “pre-empt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct,” that is, the constitutional process of impeachment, which the Ukraine investigation would soon deliver.The Mueller report also notes in its final pages that “only a successor administration would be able to prosecute a former president,” which is what the Jan. 6 special committee, with its multiple criminal referrals, has urged the Biden administration’s Justice Department to do.The Ukraine and Jan. 6 reports did their best to answer Mueller’s call.ALL THREE REPORTS INCLUDE quintessentially Trumpian scenes, consistent in their depictions of the former president’s methods, and very much in keeping with numerous journalistic accounts of how he sought to manipulate people, rules and institutions.When the Jan. 6 report shows Trump haranguing Mike Pence, telling the vice president that Pence would be known as a “patriot” if Pence helped overturn the 2020 election, it’s hard not to recall the scene in the Mueller report when the president tells Jeff Sessions that the attorney general would go down as a “hero” if he reversed his recusal from the Russia investigation.All three reports show Trump deploying the mechanisms of government for political gain. Less than four months into his term, Trump relies on a Department of Justice memo as cover to fire the F.B.I. director; he uses the Office of Management and Budget to delay the disbursal of military aid to Ukraine in 2019; and he attempts to use fake state electoral certificates to upend the results of the 2020 vote.Perhaps no moment is more believable than the Ukraine report’s description of Trump’s April 2019 conversation with the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, when Trump makes a point of mentioning that Ukraine is “always very well represented” in the Miss Universe pageants.Still, each investigation offers a slightly different theory of Trump. In the Mueller report, Trump and his aides come across as the gang that can’t cheat straight — too haphazard to effectively coordinate with a foreign government, too ignorant of campaign finance laws to purposely violate them, often comically naïve about the gravity of their plight. When Michael Flynn resigns from the White House after admitting to lying about his contacts with Russian officials, Trump consoles him with the assurance, “We’ll give you a good recommendation,” as if Flynn were a departing mailroom intern rather than a disgraced ex-national security adviser.When the Trump campaign tried to conceal details surrounding its infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016, the Mueller report suggests that the effort “may reflect an intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality,” that is, that the Trump team might have felt just shame, not guilt.The Mueller report rebuts the Trumpian notion that the president can employ his legitimate authority regardless of the illegitimacy of his purpose. “An improper motive can render an actor’s conduct criminal even when the conduct would otherwise be lawful and within the actor’s authority,” the report states, in the patient tone of a parent explaining household rules to a child. But even in the damning sections on Trump’s potential obstruction of justice (in which the office all but states that it would have charged Trump if it could have), the report theorizes that the president may have been attacking the inquiries against him out of concern that they hindered his ability to govern, not because he was hiding some nefarious activity.The Ukraine report, by contrast, regards Trump as more strategic than chaotic, and it does not wallow in the netherworld between the president’s personal benefit and his public service. “The president placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security,” Representative Adam Schiff declares in the report’s preface.The three investigations tell different stories, but the misdeeds all run together, more overlapping than sequential. The president’s effort to squeeze Zelensky’s government into investigating the Biden family (ironically, under the guise of Trump’s anti-corruption concerns) was an attempt to manipulate the 2020 election, while his desire for Ukraine to investigate its own supposed U.S. election interference (on behalf of the Democrats, naturally) was part of Trump’s ongoing battle to defend the glorious memory of his 2016 victory. “We were struck by the fact that the president’s misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, nor was it the product of a naïve president,” Schiff writes. Indeed, several weeks before Trump’s famous phone conversation with Zelensky on July 25, 2019, Trump had already ordered a hold on hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, which it would dangle as leverage. And the purely political nature of the enterprise was made plain when the report notes that Trump did not care if Ukraine in fact conducted any investigations. It simply had to announce them.The Mueller report argues that viewing the president’s “acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance.” The Ukraine report shows that the conversation that Trump described as “a perfect call” was not the ask; it was the confirmation. When Trump said, “I would like you to do us a favor, though,” Zelensky and his aides had already been notified of what was coming. The Ukraine scandal was never about a single call, just as the Jan. 6 report was not about a single day.The Jan. 6 report is the most dramatic — and certainly the most readable — of the three documents. It is vaguely journalistic in style, even adopting the narrative convention of turning memorable quotes into chapter titles, like “I Just Want to Find 11,780 Votes” and “Be There, Will Be Wild!” (Contrast this with the Mueller report’s “Background Legal and Evidentiary Principles” or “Legal Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes to the President,” among its other sexy teasers.) At times, the Jan. 6 report applies too much writerly gloss. When it points out that Trump and his campaign used bogus claims of election fraud after the 2020 vote to raise more than $250 million from supporters, the report says that the Big Lie enabled “the Big Rip-off.” I’m sure someone was proud of that wording, but in this case it is more than enough just to state the facts.The Jan. 6 report takes seriously the admonition to view the president’s actions collectively, not individually; the phrase “multipart plan” appears throughout the report, with Trump as the architect. Several observers of the Trump era have described how the president learned to maneuver his way through the executive branch and grew bolder in his abuses of it; in the Jan. 6 report, that transition is complete. No longer the bumbling, reactive and instinctual occupant of the Oval Office, here Trump is fully in charge — purposely spreading false information about election fraud, pressuring Pence to refuse to certify the Electoral College count, leaning on state and local electoral officials to change the vote totals, summoning tens of thousands of supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, and urging them to march to the Capitol, then standing by for hours as the violent attack was underway. “The central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed,” the report concludes.Trump told America that he alone could fix it; the Jan. 6 report tells us that he alone could break it.Even more so than the Ukraine report, the Jan. 6 report repeatedly emphasizes how Trump knew, well, everything. “Donald Trump’s own campaign officials told him early on that his claims of fraud were false,” Liz Cheney, the committee vice chair, writes in her introduction. “Donald Trump’s senior Justice Department officials — each appointed by Donald Trump himself — investigated the allegations and told him repeatedly that his fraud claims were false. Donald Trump’s White House lawyers also told him his fraud claims were false.”There is no room here for the plausible deniability that the Mueller report entertained, for the notion that Trump didn’t know better, or that, in the immortal words of Attorney General William P. Barr when he creatively interpreted the Mueller report to exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice, that the president was “frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency.”This alleged sincerity underscored the president’s “noncorrupt motives,” as Barr put it. In the Jan. 6 report, any case for Trumpian sincerity is eviscerated in a six-page chart in the executive summary, which catalogs the many times the president was informed of the facts of the election yet continued to lie about them. “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen,” Trump told top Department of Justice officials in late December 2020, the report says.Just announce an investigation into the Bidens. Just say the 2020 election was rigged. Trump’s most corrupt action is always the corruption of reality.The Jan. 6 report devotes a chapter to explaining how the president purposely mustered a mob to Washington, how his “will be wild!” call-out on social media united rival extremist groups in a common cause, and how he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell” to obstruct the affirmation of a legitimate vote.Two days before his speech, Trump had already floated the idea to advisers that he would join the protesters at the Capitol, and he even briefly considered deploying 10,000 members of the National Guard “to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counterprotesters,” the report states.This is among the most remarkable moments in the Jan. 6 chronicle. Rather than worry about violence against lawmakers and the Capitol itself, Trump was focused on protecting his supporters. They interpreted the president’s call to join him in Washington that day as a command to save their country, violently if necessary, and they stood down only when he issued a video instructing them to do so. The Jan. 6 report, in a dramatic but not inaccurate flourish, affirms that, during the assault on the Capitol, Trump “was not only the commander in chief of the U.S. military, but also of the rioters.”On that day, he chose to lead the rioters. Jan. 6 was the closest Trump would get to holding that military parade he so longed to see in Washington. Instead of parading in front of the Capitol, his troops marched against it.AFTER MAKING THE CASE that Trump incited the assault, the Jan. 6 report expresses shock at how little Trump did to stop it, an act of omission it labels a “dereliction of duty.” Yet, by the report’s own logic, why would Trump have stopped the insurrectionists? “President Trump had summoned a mob, including armed extremists and conspiracy theorists, to Washington, D.C., on the day the joint session of Congress was to meet,” the report states. “He then told that same mob to march on the U.S. Capitol and ‘fight.’ They clearly got the message.” (Some variation of the word “fight” appeared only twice in Trump’s prepared speech for his Jan. 6 speech, but the president would utter the word 20 times throughout his remarks, the report notes.) If the rioters were in fact doing his bidding, the president would have no reason to call them off once the mayhem began.That Trump would rile people up and then sit back and watch the outcome on television was the least surprising part of the day. It was how he spent his presidency. In calling out Trump’s failure to act, the Jan. 6 report was imagining that Trump, in that moment, might have become presidential at last, shocked by what his own actions wrought into being something other than himself. In its condemnation of Trump, the report still longed for his transformation. After so many pages, so much testimony, so much analysis, it still struggled to understand him.The challenges of interpreting and describing what another person was thinking, doing or intending at a particular moment — even a person as overanalyzed as Donald J. Trump — come alive in one passage, or rather, one word, of the Jan. 6 report. The issue is not even the word itself, but the form in which it is rendered.The report cites the testimony of a White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, who explained how, on the morning of Jan. 6, the president was incensed that the presence of magnetometers (used to detect weapons) was inhibiting some armed supporters from entering the Ellipse, where the president was to deliver his speech.As always, Trump wanted a bigger crowd. Hutchinson said she heard him say something like, “I don’t F’ing care that they have weapons. They’re not here to hurt me. Take the F’ing mags away. Let my people in.”They’re not here to hurt me. Which word should one emphasize when uttering that sentence aloud? If it is the verb “hurt,” the sentiment would be somewhat benign. They are not here to hurt me, the president might have meant, but to praise or cheer or support me. If the emphasis falls on “me,” however, the meaning is more sinister. They’re not here to hurt me, the implication would be, but to hurt someone else. That someone else could be Mike Pence, Nancy Pelosi, an officer of the Capitol Police or any of the lawmakers gathering to fulfill their duty and certify Joe Biden as president.So, which was it? The Jan. 6 report confuses matters by italicizing “me” in the document’s final chapter but leaving it unitalicized in the executive summary. The video of Hutchinson’s testimony shows her reciting the line quickly and neutrally, with perhaps a slight emphasis on “hurt” rather than “me.” (You can watch and listen for yourself.)Of course, the less ambiguous interpretation of Trump’s words is that either inflection — whether “hurt” or “me” — still means the president was unconcerned about anyone’s safety but his own. Perhaps “I don’t F’ing care” is the most relevant phrase.With a document surpassing 800 pages, it may seem too much to linger on the typeface of a single two-letter pronoun. But for accounts that can serve as both historical records and briefs for the prosecution, every word and every quote — every framing and every implication — is a choice that deserves scrutiny.The studious restraint of the Mueller report came in for much criticism once the special counsel failed to deliver a dagger to the heart of the Trump presidency and once the document was so easily miscast by interested parties. Even its copious redactions, justified by the opaque phrase “Harm to Ongoing Matter” appearing over a sea of blotted-out text, seemed designed to frustrate. Yet, for all its diffidence, there is power in the document’s understated prose, in its methodical collection of evidence, in its unwillingness to overstep its bounds while investigating a president who knew few bounds himself.The Ukraine and Jan. 6 reports came at a time when Trump’s misconduct was better understood, when Mueller-like restraint was less in fashion and when those attempting to hold the chief executive accountable grasped every tool at hand. For all their passion and bluntness, they encountered their own constraints, limits that are probably inherent to the form, to the challenge of recording on paper and by committee the impulses not just of a man but of an era with which he became synonymous.Expectations are heaped upon these reports, not only for what they might reveal, but for what those revelations might unleash, or what they might help repair. Such demands are excessive and probably counterproductive. It is hard enough to determine the true meaning of a lone word, to reconstruct a fleeting moment in history. It is harder still to reconstruct a nation’s political life, that other ongoing matter to which so much harm has been done.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

3,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/14/business/media/tv-historical-dramas-fictional.html,"The following stories are not based on real events. In fact, they’re completely made up — even though they’re meant to seem real.No, Queen Elizabeth’s staff never hid a copy of The Sunday Times from her because of a devastating, but nonexistent, front-page headline: “Queen Should Abdicate in Favour of Prince of Wales — Half of British Public Agrees.”No, the former Los Angeles Lakers head coach Jerry West didn’t fly into fits of rage so violent that he tossed his Most Valuable Player trophy through a window in his office.And no, the two police officers who unwittingly missed an opportunity to arrest Jeffrey Dahmer before he could kill again were not given honors as officers of the year by the Milwaukee Police Department.But the millions of people who watched three of the most popular historical dramas of the last year — “The Crown” and “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story” on Netflix and HBO’s “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty” — were left to separate fact from fiction on their own.These series are hardly outliers in the flourishing genre of based-on-a-true-story entertainment.As the number of shows and movies that depict real events has grown in recent years — never before have dramatizations of well-known people and events been so popular and prevalent — so, too, have the liberties that screenwriters are taking with the facts.In many instances, these are not mere embellishments for dramatic flair but major fabrications. Some of the people who claim they’ve been reduced to crude caricatures onscreen are suing for defamation. And shows like “The Crown” have been forced to belatedly add disclaimers stating that what people are watching is in fact a dramatized version of real events.ImageOlivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II in “The Crown.” A British journalist who has fact-checked the series said some scenes were “a complete perversion of history.”Credit...Mark Mainz Des Willie/NetflixSometimes disclaimers are enough to protect a studio from legal liability, especially if they are prominently displayed in the opening credits and offer detail of what has been fictionalized — beyond a generic acknowledgment such as “based on real events,” legal experts say. The First Amendment offers broad protections for expressive works like film and television productions that depict real people by their real names.But if someone can convincingly claim that he or she was harmed by what screenwriters made up, that is grounds for a strong defamation suit, said Jean-Paul Jassy, a lawyer who works on media and First Amendment cases in Los Angeles.“A disclaimer is not a silver bullet,” he said.“And this is where it gets very tricky with docudramas,” Mr. Jassy added. “A court could say: ‘I understand there are fictionalized elements of your show. But you used a real person’s name, and you presented as fact something that’s false that hurt their reputation.’”Lawsuits fail more often than not because very few fans of these shows probably believe they are watching history as it literally unfolded. Hollywood has, of course, always amped up the drama when telling — and selling — true stories.But when shows like “The Crown” become so popular because — at least to some degree — viewers believe they are getting an education, the liberties taken by writers go beyond dramatic license, say those who have a stake in getting the facts straight.Hugo Vickers, a British journalist who has been fact-checking episodes of “The Crown” for The Sunday Times and is the author of several books about the monarchy, called some of what has transpired over the show’s five seasons “a complete perversion of history.”“They do it all the time,” Mr. Vickers said. “And they couldn’t care less.”Netflix added a disclaimer after criticism from high places about the inaccuracies in “The Crown,” including from the famed British actress Judi Dench and former Prime Minister John Major over a scene that depicted an imagined conversation between Mr. Major and Prince Charles about the queen’s possible abdication. But the disclaimer, saying the series is “inspired by real events,” appeared not on the show itself but rather on its press materials and in the trailer, which aired on YouTube.A disclaimer also appears in HBO’s show on the Lakers, saying in part, “This series is a dramatization of certain facts and events.” But Mr. West, the former coach, and some of his players found that wholly insufficient. Through his lawyer, Mr. West demanded an apology from HBO, saying the show “falsely and cruelly” maligned him as an “an out-of-control, intoxicated rage-aholic.”Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the former Lakers center and a central character in “Winning Time,” accused HBO of “heavy-handed virtue signaling” for inventing scenes meant to highlight the sexist treatment many women endured in the workplace in the 1970s.In his Substack newsletter, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar wrote that the show’s attempt to draw attention to the issue was offensive because it depicted one female team executive unbuttoning her blouse and fixing her hair before meeting with her future boss — something the executive has said never happened.The scene, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar said, “reduces her intelligence and competence for a cheap joke.”HBO said in a statement that it “has a long history of producing compelling content drawn from actual facts and events that are fictionalized in part for dramatic purposes.” The network added, “‘Winning Time’ and its depictions, as with other similar shows, are based on extensive factual research and reliable sourcing.”HBO is not the only studio that has invented story lines that have a poignant social and cultural resonance today.Image“When They See Us” dramatized the “Central Park Five” rape case as a rush to condemn the accused.Credit...Atsushi Nishijima/NetflixDefamation experts and Hollywood studios are closely watching developments in a lawsuit filed against Netflix by Linda Fairstein, a former prosecutor who objected to her depiction in a 2019 series about the “Central Park Five” case, “When They See Us.” The show dramatizes how law enforcement in New York City, including Ms. Fairstein, rushed to condemn five Black and Latino teenagers — all of whom were eventually exonerated — for the rape of a white woman who was jogging in Central Park in 1989.In the series, Ms. Fairstein is shown withholding evidence, encouraging the police to harshly interrogate the suspects and expressing a callous disregard for the truth about whether they were actually guilty. After the show was released, and a backlash against Ms. Fairstein on social media ensued, her book publisher dropped her and she was forced to resign from her position on several boards.Ms. Fairstein has said her portrayal is “grossly and maliciously inaccurate,” and she sued in March 2020. A federal judge ruled that her claims of defamation in five separate scenes in the series were plausible, and the case is proceeding in U.S. District Court. Ava DuVernay, the show’s creator, consulted with the wrongfully accused men, but not with Ms. Fairstein.In court filings, lawyers for Netflix argued that the script was clearly protected under the First Amendment as “an artistic dramatization of controversial and contested historical events.”ImageLinda Fairstein, left, in 1990, when she ran the Manhattan district attorney office’s sex-crimes unit.Credit...Chester Higgins, Jr./The New York TimesImageIn “When They See Us,” Felicity Huffman portrayed Ms. Fairstein, who called the role “grossly and maliciously inaccurate.”Credit...NetflixWith the heightened sensitivity toward confronting racial and gender inequality, many Hollywood screenwriters are turning these issues into major story lines, even if that means sometimes exaggerating the details. This was the case in “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” one of Netflix’s biggest hits of the last year.While the series uses historical records to accurately portray much of how Dahmer, the cannibalistic serial killer, preyed on young men and got away with it for so long, including court transcripts from his 1992 trial, it invents moments to convey how systemic failures in the criminal justice system allowed him to remain at large.The opening scene of “Monster,” for instance, shows one of the characters, a Black woman, watching a report on the evening news that unsettles her: Five white Milwaukee police officers had beaten up a Black undercover officer, thinking he was a criminal.But when The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel fact-checked the series — and revealed more than a few inaccuracies — it found no reports of any incident like that in Milwaukee. The only report that seemed to match, the paper said, occurred in Tennessee a year after Dahmer was arrested.Anne E. Schwartz, a former police reporter who was on the scene the night Dahmer was arrested and later wrote a book about the case, faulted the writers for projecting themes that are far more salient today onto events that happened more than 30 years ago.“We’re going back and looking at this case from the lens of 2022, not 1990,” she said.When HBO debuted a biographical drama last year about Julia Child, the celebrity chef, some who knew her said it had inaccurately portrayed her husband, Paul, as being threatened by her success. And Ms. Child’s longtime producer complained that he was wrongly shown as skeptical about her first cooking program — a barrier-breaking success for a woman on television in the 1960s.ImageSarah Lancashire and David Hyde Pierce as Julia and Paul Child in “Julia.”Credit...Seacia Pavao/HBO MaxLawyers who represent studios say it’s often not feasible — or legally necessary — to fact-check scripts for historical accuracy. And it’s uncommon for producers to involve the people whose lives they are fictionalizing. They’re under no legal obligation to do so.“In the industry, most real-life people are not consulted very much because it’s a pain for the filmmakers,” said Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to the movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Ms. Perkins worked with the producers on “She Said,” the new drama that follows New York Times reporters as they uncover Mr. Weinstein’s decades of sexual abuse of women.“I think that the film industry has an enormous way to go if they’re going to continue making stories about real-life people at the speed that they do,” she added. “Because actually having gone through it with being treated fairly respectfully, I cannot even imagine the damage it must cause to people who weren’t collaborated with.”Filmmakers often try to be as sensitive as possible to the people whose stories they’re telling, said Brad Simpson, producer of the “American Crime Story” anthology, which covered three dramatic moments in recent history — the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the assassination of Gianni Versace and President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. That’s why, Mr. Simpson said, he and his colleagues involved Monica Lewinsky in their series “Impeachment” to help her regain control of her version of what had happened.“I think when you’re making TV based on real people, you always have to be incredibly aware that there are real victims at the center of all these stories,” he said.But Mr. Simpson, who likened the current popular fascination with true crime to what the nation experienced in the 1960s and ’70s with “In Cold Blood” and “Helter Skelter,” acknowledged that at the end of the day, what he and other producers were doing was creating entertainment.“It’s really hard for people when you have been part of a true story and then you see your experience onscreen. Your natural instinct is to feel violated and to feel like: ‘Well, nobody spoke to me. Or I should be paid for my story,’” Mr. Simpson said.“That’s not the way the law works,” he added. “That’s not the way these shows get made or written.”And the cold reality, he said, is “your story can be used to sell streaming subscriptions.”"
4,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/opinion/donald-trump-criminal-referral-insurrection.html,"On Monday, at the final public hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee, Representative Bennie Thompson said that any attempt to overturn the legitimate results of an American election, impede the peaceful transfer of power or foment an insurrection must never be allowed to happen again. To that end, Representative Jamie Raskin firmly announced that the committee was making four criminal referrals whose center, in each, was Donald Trump, the man who hatched a scheme that would, if successful, defraud Americans of their sacred right to have their vote count.These unprecedented referrals suggest that Mr. Trump, who as president took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not only violated that oath but also committed a series of specifically indictable crimes. One of these referrals — for the crime of inciting an insurrection — is the most stunning, the most unpredictable and the most crucial, for its implications and its remedy, which includes barring the former president from holding political office.In making these referrals, the committee was certainly considering the past as well. Representative Liz Cheney spoke movingly of her great-great-grandfather, Samuel Fletcher Cheney, who served in the Union’s 21st Regiment, Ohio Infantry, during the Civil War. After the war, he marched with his fellow soldiers in the Grand Review of the Armies, passing President Andrew Johnson in the reviewing stand. She might also have added that Johnson, the 17th president of the United States, would soon be impeached. Like Donald Trump. And like Donald Trump, he was acquitted.Johnson then returned to office, almost as if nothing had happened. That’s a cautionary tale.After Ulysses S. Grant won the election of 1868, Johnson went home to Tennessee, where he began to plot his comeback. Since he possessed a talent for uniting moderate and radical Republicans along with Democrats and former secessionists, many of whom either hated him or now wanted nothing more to do with him, it wouldn’t be easy. But it wasn’t illegal.He hadn’t tried to overturn the election of Grant. He hadn’t impeded the peaceful transfer of power. (But like Mr. Trump, he refused to attend his successor’s inauguration.) He had abused power, usurping the function of Congress, which has the right to determine the qualifications of its own members — all the more critical after a civil war in which 11 states had been in rebellion.As for inciting or aiding an insurrection, that was arguable. Though a staunch Unionist, in 1866 Johnson had stood by silently during the massacre in New Orleans that prevented a state convention from amending its Constitution to give Black men the vote. The mob included members of the New Orleans police department, which was largely composed of former rebels. They were supported by the mayor, a Confederate sympathizer, who had been jailed during the war as a traitor and elected even before he was pardoned.An 1867 congressional investigation into that tragedy reported that more than 35 people, the vast majority of them Black, had died, and roughly 145 people were wounded. It also found that the massacre would never have happened without Johnson’s tacit approval. The abolitionist Wendell Phillips predicted that “what New Orleans is today, Washington will be” — “ruled by the president and his mob.”In 1868, when he was finally impeached, the 10th article of impeachment accused Johnson of ridiculing Congress and setting aside its authority, and the 11th article involved his obstructing its laws. During the impeachment trial, when Representative John Bingham of Ohio argued for the president’s conviction, he reminded senators that “none are above the law; that no man lives for himself alone, ‘but each for all.’” With tears in his eyes, he concluded that “position, however high, patronage, however powerful, cannot be permitted to shelter crime to the peril of the Republic.”But since the Senate did not convict Andrew Johnson, there was no way to disqualify him from holding office. He may have abused power, ridiculed Congress, arrogated to himself a form of Reconstruction that enshrined white supremacy, but the arguable criminal charge (violating the Tenure of Office Act) did not stick — and even if it had, it was an impeachment tribunal, not a court of law, that had charged him.So a disgraced Johnson returned to Washington in 1875 as a senator from Tennessee. He did not believe he was disgraced. He believed he had done nothing wrong, and though he might have been a bit foul-mouthed, he wanted to know: Who wasn’t? Certainly no one had ever suggested a criminal referral. That is new. Until this week, nothing like it had happened. And the implications are far-reaching.“So we are to have Andrew Johnson back again,” the Washington journalist Mary Clemmer Ames wrote with some surprise. Not only did he return to the Senate (though he died only a few months after he was sworn in), by the 20th century, history resurrected Andrew Johnson. He would be seen just as he saw himself, the persecuted victim of vicious political enemies.Which brings us to the investigation into the Capitol riot and the Jan. 6 committee’s four referrals to the Department of Justice for obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement and for inciting or assisting an insurrection or offering aid and comfort to its participants. The last is the most important. Violating 18 U.S.C. 2383, which derives from a law dating to the Civil War, carries the penalty that, if convicted, Donald Trump “shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”Here, at last, is an accountability that goes beyond what the impeachment managers, regardless of their brilliant arguments, were able to do in 2021. Here is the uncompromising statement that while an insurrection is an impeachable offense — Mr. Trump was after all impeached by the House of Representatives — it is also unequivocally and horribly a criminal act.This specific referral then holds out the hope that Mr. Trump will not be permitted to hold elective or appointed political office ever again. That was arguably the point of the impeachment: to make sure that his political career had ended.Now, whatever the Department of Justice decides to do and whatever the special counsel Jack Smith discovers or determines, the Jan. 6 committee has achieved what the impeachment of Mr. Trump could not: a series of referrals that caps an expansive and heart-rending investigation into the abuse of power, the obstruction of Congress and the aiding and abetting of a rebellion, condoned, if not designed, by an American president. That president will be remembered as lawless, indicted or not, and will be disgraced in perpetuity, as Andrew Johnson should have been.Brenda Wineapple is the author of “The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation.” She is at work on a book about the Scopes trial.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

6,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/africa/south-africa-cyril-ramaphosa-impeachment.html,"JOHANNESBURG — Lawmakers from South Africa’s governing African National Congress put their weight behind President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday, rejecting an effort to proceed with an impeachment inquiry over accusations that he broke the law in his response to the theft of a large sum of U.S. currency from his farm.The vote essentially kills an effort to remove Mr. Ramaphosa from office and lifts his political prospects just three days before the start of a national conference for his party, the A.N.C., at which he is expected to face a grueling battle to win a second term as party leader.The A.N.C. holds 230 of the 400 seats in Parliament, and his opponents fell far short of the 31 A.N.C. members they needed to break ranks and vote for impeachment hearings. In all, 214 members of Parliament voted against continuing with the inquiry, while 148 voted in favor of it.Last week, the A.N.C.’s executive committee instructed its members to reject impeachment, making it difficult for any of them to vote the other way because the party appoints them to Parliament. Breaking with instructions could have serious repercussions within the organization, including losing their seats.Still, a handful of A.N.C. lawmakers did defy the order.“As a disciplined member of the A.N.C., I vote yes,” said Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a minister in Mr. Ramaphosa’s cabinet who has criticized him heavily and challenged him for president of the party. Several allies of former President Jacob Zuma, who was dogged by corruption allegations during his tenure that eventually forced him from office, also voted for the impeachment process.Gwede Mantashe, the chairman of the A.N.C., told reporters after the vote that party members who voted in favor of impeachment proceedings would be reported to the organization’s officials and could face discipline.“When we have discussion as a party and take decisions, they must be binding,” Mr. Mantashe said.The report calling for impeachment hearings, issued by a three-member panel appointed by Parliament, said that Mr. Ramaphosa may have violated the Constitution and the law when he failed to tell the police about the break-in at his farm, and by conducting private business that conflicted with his duties as a public official.Before the vote, opposition parties had lobbied for a secret ballot, in the hope that it would give Mr. Ramaphosa’s critics within the A.N.C. more breathing room to ignore party leaders. Some claimed that they had received anonymous death threats, warning them not to back the impeachment process. But the speaker of Parliament, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, a senior A.N.C. member, rejected that effort.In the debate preceding the vote, members of Mr. Ramaphosa’s party defended him, pointing to the panel report’s limited investigation. “The panel’s report has set the bar too low to impeach a sitting president,” said Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.Outnumbered opposition lawmakers tried to appeal to members of the ruling party. “The hate that exists in your party is impacting negatively on the entire 60 million people in this country,” said Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam, a member of the National Freedom Party.Mr. Ramaphosa has filed a petition in court challenging the report calling for an impeachment inquiry, arguing that it was legally deficient and accusing the panel of treating him unfairly by going beyond its original scope.Parliament created the system of convening a panel to make a recommendation on impeachment several years ago after the nation’s highest court ruled that the A.N.C. had failed to hold Mr. Zuma accountable for misusing public funds. It was meant to allow for a nonpolitical assessment of a president’s conduct.But the panel could not interview witnesses or subpoena records. Instead, it mostly reviewed information obtained from members of Parliament, much of which was based on media reports and other secondhand accounts of what occurred at the president’s farm.The outcome, opposition leaders said, was that the system has essentially remained the same: The A.N.C. could choose to shield its leaders from accountability.“The A.N.C. has not learned anything,” said Julius Malema, a former A.N.C. member who is now the leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters. “It is rotten to the core. It has got no ability to self-correct.”Mr. Ramaphosa has been under intense scrutiny since June, when a political opponent filed a criminal complaint against him for not reporting the burglary at his game farm, Phala Phala Wildlife.ImageSupporters of Mr. Ramaphosa demonstrated in Cape Town on Tuesday before a debate on a report by a panel of experts who said he might have violated his oath of office.Credit...Esa Alexander/ReutersThe complaint, filed by Arthur Fraser, the former head of state security in South Africa, said that between $4 million and $8 million hidden in a sofa had been stolen in February 2020, and it accused Mr. Ramaphosa of enlisting the head of his security detail to open an off-the-books investigation that led to the kidnapping and torture of the suspects in the case.The president has denied any wrongdoing. He said the amount stolen was significantly less, $580,000, and that the money came from the sale of 20 buffaloes to a Sudanese businessman on Christmas Day in 2019.The parliamentary panel, which included two retired judges and a lawyer, was skeptical of Mr. Ramaphosa’s version of events and questioned whether the money stolen actually came from the sale of game.Mr. Ramaphosa considered resigning after the panel released its report last month, advisers said, but his allies rallied around him and urged him to fight back.He has since forged ahead with his presidential duties and his quest for re-election as the president of the A.N.C. — a status that would almost guarantee him a second term as president of the country.The president has staked much of his tenure on cleaning up the corruption within the A.N.C. and the government that has damaged the country’s economy and reputation, and contributed to a significant loss of electoral support for a party that established itself as a moral force in the apartheid era.His main rival for party president at the conference, scheduled to begin on Friday, is Zweli Mkhize. He served as health minister under Mr. Ramaphosa until becoming entangled in his own corruption scandal over a communications contract that his ministry awarded to a company owned by close associates. Mr. Mkhize did not attend the vote in Parliament.He has told reporters that the executive committee, which he belongs to, had bullied members into deciding not to pursue impeachment. He said that members of Parliament needed to be given space to make up their own minds."
7,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/world/africa/south-africa-ramaphosa-anc.html,"JOHANNESBURG — South Africa’s governing party, the African National Congress, is standing by its president, Cyril Ramaphosa, rejecting calls that he face an impeachment hearing over accusations that he kept a large sum of cash in a sofa at his game farm and failed to report a crime when it was stolen.The decision by the executive committee of the A.N.C. was announced on Monday after an all-day meeting — essentially killing a report that had been prepared by a three-member panel recommending that impeachment hearings go ahead.“It means the president continues with his duties as president of the A.N.C. and the republic,” Paul Mashatile, the A.N.C.’s treasurer general, said at a news conference after the meeting. “The decision that we take is in the best interest of the country.”But the president is hardly out of the woods. He still has to answer to several other investigations, including by the A.N.C.’s integrity committee, the national prosecutor’s office and the public protector, a corruption watchdog, as Mr. Mashatile pointed out. And his bid to win a second term as A.N.C. president in elections to be held in less than two weeks is hardly a sure thing.Mr. Ramaphosa has been under fire since a criminal complaint filed by a political foe in June alleged that millions of dollars in U.S. currency was stolen from a couch in a game farm, Phala Phala Wildlife, owned by the president. The complaint alleged that Mr. Ramaphosa never reported the theft and tried to cover it up to avoid the publicity — and potential legal violations — over having that much foreign currency hidden at his private residence.A damning report issued last week by two retired judges and a lawyer said that he might have violated the Constitution, and recommended that Parliament begin impeachment hearings. On Monday, Mr. Ramaphosa filed a legal challenge in the nation’s highest court challenging the report.Parliament was scheduled to convene on Tuesday to vote on whether to adopt the report and hold impeachment hearings, but that meeting was delayed until next week. A.N.C. members hold a majority of the seats in Parliament. While they are not required to do what their executive committee says, analysts say it is highly unlikely that they will break ranks in what is expected to be a public vote.The executive committee’s decision may be a sign of Mr. Ramaphosa’s strength within the party ahead of elections for the party’s leadership. Still, the president has staunch critics within the A.N.C. who have committed to trying everything possible to deny him a second term in office.The elections come at a particularly fraught time for the A.N.C., Africa’s oldest liberation movement. Its support has been waning. Its next leader faces the tall task of helping to boost public confidence in the party as it tries to retain its outright majority in Parliament in the 2024 elections.Mr. Mashatile said the A.N.C.’s 80-member executive committee was mostly united in the view that it was the president’s prerogative to challenge the report in the Constitutional Court, the nation’s highest judicial body.But there was a lengthy debate over the content of the report, he said. Some wanted to reject it, while others thought its findings should be considered. Ultimately, he said, the committee decided the report should not be adopted while it was up for legal review. Opposition political parties are planning to vigorously push for Parliament to proceed with an impeachment hearing.Julius Malema, the president of the Economic Freedom Fighters, one of the opposition parties, said that if the A.N.C. voted against the recommendations of the report, “it will be showing the Constitution a middle finger.”Mr. Ramaphosa has maintained that he has done nothing wrong. He said that the amount stolen from his farm was $580,000 — not millions — and that the money was the proceeds from the sale of buffaloes.But when the report by the panel appointed by Parliament was released last week, Mr. Ramaphosa considered resigning, advisers said, under heavy pressure from his opponents within the A.N.C., as well as rival political parties.Though his political perch seemed tenuous in the immediate aftermath of the report’s release, Mr. Ramaphosa and his allies have since come out swinging.On social media, his supporters have questioned the impartiality of a lawyer on the panel, posting a video of her interacting and laughing with some of the president’s detractors. Rallies in support of Mr. Ramaphosa have been convened, and his allies in the party have suggested that those who wanted him ousted were criminals afraid of his anticorruption agenda.They have also called the report deeply flawed.“It’s a nonsense report,” Zamani Saul, the premier of Northern Cape Province and a Ramaphosa supporter, said in an interview. “It’s inconclusive on everything.”But analysts say the A.N.C.’s rejection of the report could have consequences for a party that has already lost a lot of electoral support, in part because of rampant corruption within its ranks.Many South Africans are looking at the A.N.C.’s decision to reject the report and wondering if the party “under Ramaphosa may not be as dedicated as it says it is in the fight against corruption,” said Pearl Mncube, a political analyst based in Pretoria, the nation’s executive capital.The process for impeaching a president was overhauled five years ago, when the Constitutional Court ruled that the A.N.C. did not hold its previous president, Jacob Zuma, accountable for misusing public funds to renovate his rural homestead. The requirement for convening a three-member panel to make recommendations on impeachment was meant to inject a nonpartisan voice in the process.But the Constitution gives the final say on impeachment to lawmakers, said Lawson Naidoo, the executive secretary of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution.“Ultimately, it is a political decision whether the president is impeached or not,” Mr. Naidoo said."
8,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/world/africa/south-africa-president-ramaphosa-farmgate.html,"JOHANNESBURG — The story begins when a Sudanese businessman landed in the Johannesburg airport two days before Christmas 2019, according to his account, rolling a carry-on suitcase with $600,000 in cash. He said he had wanted to surprise his South African wife for her birthday, and buy a house.Instead, according to Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, that cash somehow ended up stashed inside a sofa in the private residence of his game farm.This convoluted story — and whether it is at all credible — is the subject of a scandal that has riveted South Africa and threatened to unseat Mr. Ramaphosa from the presidency. On Friday, his party, the African National Congress, convenes its national conference, held every five years, where some 4,000 delegates will decide whether to elect Mr. Ramaphosa to a second term as their leader. Given the A.N.C.’s dominance of South African politics, the person elected party president has always become South Africa’s president.A protégé of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ramaphosa, 70, rose to power five years ago carrying hopes that he could save the A.N.C., a once-vaunted liberation movement now facing a reckoning over rampant corruption and a failure to provide basic services.ImageThe president’s game farm, Phala Phala Wildlife, where a Sudanese businessman said that, practically on a whim, he bought 20 buffaloes for $580,000. Credit...Joao Silva/The New York TimesHis rhetoric about good governance and record as a businessman gave South Africans hope that he would clean house and help the A.N.C. focus on rescuing Africa’s most industrialized economy.But now, much of the country — including opposition lawmakers, political analysts and even some of the president’s allies — can’t help but wonder whether he simply represents the same old corruption of the ruling elite.“Unfortunately, now he’s got that cloud hanging over his head,” said Lindiwe Zulu, a senior A.N.C. official and member of the president’s cabinet who has been supportive of him. Referring to the scandal, she said, “People are going to be asking a question: ‘How on earth do you have something like that being a president?’”The scandal known as Farmgate erupted in June, after Arthur Fraser, South Africa’s former spy chief and a political opponent of Mr. Ramaphosa, filed a criminal complaint accusing him of failing to report to the police the theft of at least $4 million from the president’s farm.Mr. Fraser accused the president of instructing his head of security to conduct a covert investigation instead, which resulted in the kidnapping and torturing of the burglary suspects, some of whom fled across the border to Namibia. One of those suspects, Floriana Joseph, a housekeeper at the president’s game farm, Phala Phala Wildlife, was accused in Mr. Fraser’s complaint of helping to plot the burglary and then being paid off by the president to keep quiet about it.Ms. Joseph lives in a tiny settlement, Vingerkraal, a spread of boxy tin shacks on dirt lots housing many Namibian exiles, about a 45-minute drive from Phala Phala. On a recent visit with Times reporters, she kept up her guard as she spoke, eyebrows arched, as she cradled her son.Ms. Joseph, 28, said she never saw money in the president’s couch, let alone coordinated a robbery. The first time she had ever even heard of the break-in, she said, was in a report on a local radio station in June. No investigators had questioned her before that, she said, contradicting an affidavit by the president’s head of security, who said he interviewed her in March 2020, about a month after the burglary.Now, she suspects that murky figures are out to set her up. Over the past several months, she said, random people have shown up looking for her. Some say they are with the police, while others have refused to identify themselves. She now photographs every car that drives up.In one instance, Ms. Joseph said, two men tricked her mother, who is illiterate, into filing a complaint with the police saying that Ms. Joseph had been kidnapped in 2020 — a ploy, she believes, by Mr. Ramaphosa’s opponents to give credence to the accusations in Mr. Fraser’s complaint.ImageArthur Fraser, a political opponent of Mr. Ramaphosa, filed a criminal complaint accusing him of failing to report to the police the theft of at least $4 million from the president’s farm.Credit...Associated PressAround September, she said, two men surprised her while she was shopping in the nearby town of Bela Bela. Badges that looked like police identification cards hung around their necks, she said, and they demanded that she take them to her bank. They ordered her to print out her account statements and hand them over — likely an effort to find evidence of the stolen cash, or a payoff from the president.“I told all those people who kept coming, ‘If there was money, would I be living here?’” she said, pointing to her shack.Mr. Ramaphosa has said little of all this, but presented his version of events in an affidavit.The president, an avid game breeder, said that his lodge manager had sold buffaloes to the Sudanese businessman, Hazim Mustafa Mohamed Ibrahim, for $580,000, then hid the money in a sofa in the president’s private residence because the manager worried that too many workers had access to a safe on the property.Burglars swiped the cash about a month and a half later, Mr. Ramaphosa said. He says that he reported the theft to his head of security, who is a member of the South African police force. And Mr. Ramaphosa said that Mr. Fraser’s allegation that more than $4 million was stolen was way off the mark.An independent panel appointed by Parliament to consider impeachment said it doubted that the stolen dollars had actually come from the sale of game. Mr. Ramaphosa’s detractors have gleefully picked apart his account, particularly his explanation of how the money ended up in the couch.“The money must be moved from the safe into the couch because it’s not safe in the safe, it’s safe in the couch?” asked Julius Malema, the leader of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters. “He thinks we’re all fools like him.”The Sudanese businessman, reached by telephone in Dubai, offered a version of events that largely tracks with the president’s. Mr. Ibrahim said that after declaring the cash on his arrival at the airport, he met his wife and her family at Sun City, a resort casino two and a half hours northwest of Johannesburg.ImageA demonstrator protesting before a parliamentary debate on whether to open impeachment proceedings against Mr. Ramaphosa.Credit...Esa Alexander/ReutersThe housing search fell flat, he said. Realtors, apparently, weren’t keen to show property during the holidays. But Mr. Ibrahim, who said he owns an agriculture business and a Sudanese soccer team, refused to let his U.S. dollars go to waste.He said he had a chance meeting with a game breeder at the resort. Mr. Ibrahim said he had never bought or sold game in his life, but he had already been brainstorming business ideas involving game. He was stingy with the details, but said it involved hunting.So when the breeder suggested that he go to a farm called Phala Phala because it had a great reputation for its animals, Mr. Ibrahim said, he jumped at the opportunity. He went the following day, on Christmas, driving two hours through an area with many game farms that sell animals, and said he handed over the cash to purchase 20 buffaloes to be shipped to Dubai. He said he had no clue at the time who owned the farm.But Mr. Ibrahim’s account breaks from the president’s in a crucial way. Mr. Ramaphosa said in his affidavit — to which a receipt of sale was attached — that he had sold buffaloes to Mr. Ibrahim. Mr. Ibrahim said in the interview that he had purchased Ankole, which is a breed of cattle — not buffalo. Asked about this discrepancy, Mr. Ibrahim insisted, incorrectly, that Ankole is a type of buffalo.Some breeders said in interviews that $29,000 per buffalo is not outside the realm of possibility.The animals were never delivered, Mr. Ibrahim said, because the Covid pandemic hit and travel was restricted.He said that he was seeking a refund.Mr. Ibrahim wonders what all the fuss is about. Toting large sums of cash and executing transactions on a whim were typical for him, as a businessman, he said. As we spoke by phone, he said he was in the middle of shipping a $33 million load of fertilizer — so what was $580,000 to him?“For me, it’s not too much money,” he said, chuckling. “This big drama and dilemma is a dirty political game.”South African legislators rejected an attempt this past week to start impeachment hearings against Mr. Ramaphosa. But now, whether or not he is re-elected party president at the A.N.C. conference, his legacy has taken a hit, said Kevin Malunga, a former deputy public protector, a corruption watchdog.“The halo that he had when he started off as the clean guy,” Mr. Malunga said, “has suddenly not only tilted, but kind of fallen off.”"
9,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/world/africa/cyril-ramaphosa-impeachment.html,"JOHANNESBURG — Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday moved to the brink of becoming the first South African president to face impeachment after a report found evidence that he might have broken the law in relation to a stash of money stolen at one of his properties.The finding by an independent parliamentary panel essentially amounts to a recommendation that Mr. Ramaphosa face a hearing in Parliament that could lead to his removal if two-thirds of the lawmakers vote against him.The panel cast doubt on the president’s explanation for how the large sum of U.S. currency came to be hidden in — and stolen from — a couch in his living quarters. “The information presented by the president on the storage of the money is vague and leaves unsettling gaps,” the report said.Although his ultimate fate remains to be decided, Mr. Ramaphosa now confronts the deepest crisis of his presidency, with his future as South Africa’s leader in grave doubt.The National Assembly is scheduled to meet next week to debate the report and decide whether to convene the removal hearing. Analysts say it seems likely that lawmakers will choose to proceed.Mr. Ramaphosa faces other challenges, as well.In about two weeks, his party, the African National Congress, will convene its national conference, and he is expected to face a fierce battle for a second term as its leader.His detractors within the deeply divided party have been pushing for his removal since allegations surfaced in June that he had millions of dollars stashed at his game farm, and that he had started an off-the-books investigation after the money was stolen.With an impeachment hearing perhaps imminent, those foes are likely to smell blood in the water. “His opponents inside the A.N.C. will be going for his head,” said Bongani Ngqulunga, who teaches politics at the University of Johannesburg.ImageSouth Africa’s former chief justice, Sandile Ngcobo, left, handing over the impeachment report to the speaker of Parliament, Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula, on Wednesday.Credit...Esa Alexander/ReutersIn a statement released late Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa reiterated his stance that he had done nothing to violate his constitutional oath and spoke of “an unprecedented and extraordinary moment for South Africa’s constitutional democracy.”“The conclusions of the panel require careful reading and appropriate consideration in the interest of the stability of government and that of the country,” he said.Mr. Ramaphosa rose to power in 2017 after campaigning as an anticorruption crusader. His campaign for re-election as A.N.C. leader — and as president of South Africa — got a lift last week, when nominations released from his party’s rank and file showed him ahead by a wide margin.Now that advantage could be in doubt.The national executive committee of the A.N.C. is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the panel’s finding. The president is almost certain to face a chorus of opposition. Under A.N.C. rules, officials facing criminal charges are suspended from their roles. Although the finding does not amount to criminal charges, Mr. Ramaphosa’s detractors are likely to argue that he has been morally compromised.“There’s only one message to him: He must go,” said Tony Yengeni, an executive committee member and longtime Ramaphosa opponent. “He must step aside, and he must cooperate with the police and face the music.”The president’s troubles started in June, when a political foe, Arthur Fraser, the former head of state security, filed a criminal complaint alleging that Mr. Ramaphosa had $4 million to $8 million in cash stolen from his Phala Phala game farm in February 2020 but never reported the theft to avoid scrutiny. Mr. Ramaphosa used his personal protection unit to investigate the theft, Mr. Fraser alleged. Mr. Fraser also claimed that suspects had been detained by the president’s investigators and paid off to keep quiet.In a written statement submitted to the parliamentary panel, Mr. Ramaphosa denied paying off the suspects or attempting a cover-up. He said that on Christmas Day in 2019, a Sudanese citizen, Mustafa Mohamed Ibrahim Hazim, bought 20 buffaloes from his farm. Mr. Ramaphosa said that he had not been present for the sale, but that the lodge manager had put the money in a safe on the property.A few days later, preparing to leave for time off, the manager felt uncomfortable leaving the money in the safe because several staff members had access to it, Mr. Ramaphosa wrote. So the manager stashed the cash beneath cushions of a sofa in a spare bedroom in the president’s private residence at the farm, believing that no one would break into those quarters, Mr. Ramaphosa said.About a month and a half later, on Feb. 9, 2020, the cash was stolen from the sofa.The panel found that Mr. Ramaphosa’s version of events contradicted that of his security head. And his account was marred by holes, it said, lacking a clear explanation of who the Sudanese businessman was, why there was no written record of the sale or whether he had ever collected the buffaloes he purchased.Mr. Ramaphosa abused his power as head of state to try to get help in his investigation from the president of Namibia, where some of the theft suspects fled, the report said.The panel determined that the evidence suggested that Mr. Ramaphosa had failed to report the foreign currency to South Africa’s central bank or pay taxes on it.“There are weighty considerations which leave us in substantial doubt as to whether the stolen foreign currency is the proceeds of sale,” the report said.Even more confusing was the decision to hide large sums of money in a sofa, which would have been visible to anyone, the panel said.Ultimately, the panel concluded, there was evidence that the president may have violated the Constitution in conducting private business in conflict with his official duties, and may have broken anticorruption laws in failing to report the theft to the proper authorities.ImageMr. Ramaphosa’s game farm in Limpopo Province.Credit...Joao Silva/The New York TimesMr. Ramaphosa also faces two other investigations — one by the national prosecutor’s office and another by the public protector, a corruption watchdog — that could deepen his troubles.The impeachment panel came into being at the request of an opposition party. In August, the speaker of the National Assembly, herself an A.N.C. member, initiated the procedure set out in parliamentary rules. The speaker, Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula, appointed a panel of two retired judges and a lawyer to determine whether there was evidence to support a case for impeachment.The panel’s findings essentially amount to the conclusion that Mr. Ramaphosa needs to account for his conduct and establish that he did not violate the law, said Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, a South African lawyer specializing in constitutional matters. But, he stressed, the findings do not mean the president has broken the law.“You cannot make any deductions about the validity of the charge against him,” Mr. Ngcukaitobi said.If Parliament proceeds with a hearing, Mr. Ramaphosa would be the first president to face an impeachment hearing since the process for the removal of a president was set out in the Constitution that South Africa adopted in 1996, after the end of apartheid. The law allows presidents to be removed from office if they violate the Constitution, commit gross misconduct or are physically or mentally unable to serve.The process for impeachment was changed to include the independent panel after South Africa’s top court ruled in 2017 that Parliament had failed to hold Mr. Ramaphosa’s predecessor, Jacob Zuma, to account for the web of corruption allegations he faced. Mr. Zuma resigned without ever having faced an impeachment hearing.The opposition parties who launched the inquiry have urged Mr. Ramaphosa to step down immediately.Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa, leader of the United Democratic Movement, said there was no need to go ahead with next week’s parliamentary debate, given the evidence against the president. If the president does not voluntarily step down, the A.N.C. should recall him, General Holomisa he said.“South Africa cannot afford another scenario where the nation and the world is focused on the mistakes of our president,” he said."
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/world/americas/peru-pedro-castillo-impeachment.html,"Follow for the latest on the impeachment of President Pedro Castillo.SAN LUIS DE PUÑA, Peru — At a livestock market high in the Andes Mountains in northern Peru, Estaurofila Cieza recalled the joy that erupted in the region when a fellow campesino, or poor farmer, was elected president last year.“Everyone celebrated. Every last one of us,” Ms. Cieza said. “We thought, ‘finally, someone who knows what it is to work the land.’”Last year, Pedro Castillo became Peru’s first left-wing president in more than a generation after campaigning on promises to address the poverty that rural Peruvians have long disproportionately suffered, and which worsened under the pandemic.But today he is engulfed in crisis with questions multiplying about whether his presidency will survive. The leader’s setbacks comes as Peru is saddled with economic travails that have hit Mr. Castillo’s rural base especially hard.In less than a year and a half in office, Mr. Castillo has named five different cabinets, faced six criminal investigations and, on Wednesday, confronts a third impeachment attempt in Congress, which the Peruvian leader has threatened to dissolve.Prosecutors accuse Mr. Castillo of leading a criminal organization to profit off government contracts and of repeatedly obstructing justice, charges that the president has denied.Peru’s young democracy has already been hobbled by years of high-level corruption scandals resulting in five presidents since 2016. Mr. Castillo’s tenure has only deepened the sense that the country’s political system is broken.At the same time, global supply disruptions from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have pushed the country’s inflation to the highest rate in decades, raising the stakes of political dysfunction in a nation where a quarter of the population of 33 million lives in poverty.The United Nations warned last month that Peru has the highest rate of food insecurity in South America, with half the population lacking regular access to sufficient nutrition.ImagePresident Pedro Castillo in Lima in October. He faces a third impeachment attempt in Congress.Credit...Ernesto Benavides/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesUnlike other leaders who have been part of a leftist tilt across Latin America, Mr. Castillo was never wildly popular among many voters.One of nine siblings in a family of campesinos in an area without sewage systems and far from well-equipped hospitals and schools, Mr. Castillo was a farmer who raised livestock to supplement a schoolteacher income before running for office.“There have been quite a few outsiders in Peru, but no one who is so far away from the centers of power,” said Mauricio Zavaleta, a Peruvian political analyst.During his campaign, Mr. Castillo raised expectations in rural Peru with talk of structural change, and promises to replace the country’s constitution, nationalize the extraction of natural resources and double spending on education.He took a surprise lead in the first round of elections among 20 candidates with 19 percent of the vote by courting voters disenchanted with the political establishment. In the runoff, he eked out a narrow victory over Keiko Fujimori, a polarizing figure and the daughter of a former authoritarian president, Alberto Fujimori, who is in prison for human rights violations and corruption.But today, many of Mr. Castillo’s rural supporters are struggling to purchase basic goods and services and have become disillusioned by his performance.ImagePolice officers during a protest last month in Lima against Mr. Castillo and his government.Credit...Sebastian Castaneda/ReutersCajamarca, a mostly rural region 350 miles north of Lima where Mr. Castillo was born and built his career, has long been one of the country’s poorest areas.In communities stretching from the regional capital to Mr. Castillo’s tiny home village of San Luis de Puña, supporters like Ms. Cieza said they expected more from him.“He said he was going to change the country,” she said. “He tricked us.”Since taking office, Mr. Castillo has ushered in an era of controversies noteworthy for their clumsiness and frequency, while failing to make much headway on many of his campaign promises.He has churned through more than 80 ministers and filled many posts with officials lacking relevant experience.His administration failed to purchase fertilizer for the biggest planting season of the year, after three bids by private companies were annulled because of negligence and corruption. His government has also dragged its feet on cash payments and subsidies to low-income Peruvians. Mr. Castillo has survived two impeachment attempts in Congress, where critics say he is not morally fit to be president.ImageA family building a house in Chota, the home province of Mr. Castillo. Many rural Peruvians say their lives have gotten more difficult during Mr. Castillo’s presidency.Credit...Marco Garro for The New York TimesThe Peruvian leader denies wrongdoing and has denounced what he calls a “new form of a coup” orchestrated by prosecutors, lawmakers and the media. His administration has taken an initial step toward trying to dissolve Congress in response to lawmakers’ refusal to hold a vote of confidence on his government.One congressman, Guillermo Bermejo, a close ally of Mr. Castillo, said the president’s opponents would not stop until they return power to traditional elites based in Lima, the capital.“People with fancy last names have been carving up the ham for 200 years,’’ he said in a televised interview on Sunday.Yet truckers and farmers in rural areas have staged protests in recent weeks over high prices for fuel, food and fertilizer.In Cajamarca, farmers said they planted half as many potatoes this year than in the past after prices for the most widely used synthetic fertilizer nearly tripled following the start of the Ukraine war. The cost of cooking oil, rice and sugar have doubled, making them unaffordable for the poorest Peruvians. High fuel prices has made it more expensive to get products to markets.In a slice of Peru where Mr. Castillo’s campaign slogan, “no more poor people in a rich country,” once roused cheers, today it elicits laughter.San Luis de Puña, the rural hamlet where Mr. Castillo was born, is a five-hour drive from the regional capital along mostly unpaved roads that wind through mountains and past verdant valleys, open-pit gold mines and adobe homes without electricity or running water.ImageFarm plots in Chota.

Mothers cannot afford school supplies for their children.“Now we have to work more to eat a little less,” said Cesar Irigoin, 67, a farmer in Tacabamba, the district that includes San Luis de Puña. Mr. Castillo “promised the opposite,” he added.Still, the president has his defenders.“They say he’s a bad person,” said Maria Nuñez, 77, who lives in San Luis de Puña. “No. He was a good citizen here in the community.”She blamed his difficulties on the powerful elite. “Unfortunately they’re not letting him work like they should,” she added.ImageMaria Nuñez, 77, visited a neighbor in San Luis de Puña, a rural hamlet where Mr. Castillo was born.Credit...Marco Garro for The New York TimesEven after 18 months in office, Mr. Castillo has already remained in power longer than many expected. Three of his predecessors were ousted from office early in their tenures amid a flurry of corruption scandals.Mr. Castillo seemed destined for a similar fate. But analysts say the opposition has repeatedly fumbled its attempts to position itself as the better alternative, starting with its refusal to recognize the president’s election victory last year.For weeks after the vote, Ms. Fujimori sought to annul votes from rural areas in a failed attempt to overturn the results, claiming, without evidence, that there had been electoral fraud.Congress has since blocked Mr. Castillo from traveling abroad to represent Peru on official business, turning a routine and perfunctory vote allowing a president to travel outside the country into a political weapon. Lawmakers tried to indict Mr. Castillo for treason over a comment he made in an interview about wanting to give Bolivia part of Peru’s coastline, which he quickly apologized for.“They really hate him, don’t they? Because he’s from Tacabamba,’’ Alicia Delgado, 68, a farmer who lives in Mr. Castillo’s home district, said while noting the president’s rural roots in a country where rural Peruvians have faced centuries of discrimination.ImageAlicia Delgado, 68, bought a bag of guava fruit in Chota, a rural province.

Because poor people are looked down upon.”He added that many wealthy people in Lima “look at us with contempt, because we’re always traveling by foot and coming in dirty from the fields.”ImageSegundo Huanombal, 50, during a communal lunch in the village of San Luis de Puña.Credit...Marco Garro for The New York TimesBut there is a clear sense of dismay in what had once been Mr. Castillo’s stronghold.One evening in November, Heriberto Quintana, a farmer in the province of Chota,headed out on a patrol with other members of the rondas campesinas, or security patrols, that are made up of farmers and act as a type of local police force.Mr. Quintana said that Mr. Castillo, who was part of the patrols as a young man, has used his campesino identity to gain support without actually helping the rural population.“He really offered one thing and is doing another,” he said. “It hurts more when it’s someone who knows you.”ImageMembers of the rondas campesinas, a local police force, on patrol in Chota.Credit...Marco Garro for The New York Times"
11,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/world/africa/south-africa-cyril-ramaphosa-impeachment.html,"JOHANNESBURG — President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said on Saturday that he would not resign and would instead challenge a parliamentary report that suggests he may have illegally covered up a crime at his private game farm, ending days of speculation that he might step down rather than face impeachment.Mr. Ramaphosa’s spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, said in a statement that the president would heed the call of his supporters within the African National Congress and remain in office while continuing his effort to seek re-election as the party’s leader.“The president has with humility and great care and commitment accepted that call to continue being of service to his organization, the A.N.C., and to the people of South Africa,” Mr. Magwenya said.The decision by the president to stand his ground caps a roller coaster week, in which the report was released and Mr. Ramaphosa seemed to be leaning toward resigning. His closest advisers, however, encouraged him to fight back against the accusations that he violated his oath of office.Mr. Ramaphosa has yet to emerge publicly since the report came out on Wednesday and his office said he would address the nation soon. He has previously denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime.Now Mr. Ramaphosa, a billionaire investor who was among Nelson Mandela’s favorite allies and was once seen as a champion of good governance, will have to quickly recalibrate his campaign to win a second term as the A.N.C. leader. The party, which has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994, is set to convene the conference where it chooses its leaders in Johannesburg in less than two weeks. Mr. Ramaphosa held a comfortable lead in the contest before the report’s release.ImageMembers of the African National Congress’ National Executive Committee meeting in Johannesburg on Friday. Mr. Ramaphosa is expected to seek re-election as his party’s leader. Credit...Jerome Delay/Associated PressThe report, drafted by two former judges and a lawyer, examined allegations that Mr. Ramaphosa tried to cover up the theft of a large sum of U.S. currency hidden in a sofa at a game farm he owns. The president denied any wrongdoing in the aftermath of the burglary in February 2020. He said that $580,000 that a Sudanese businessman had paid for 20 buffaloes was stolen, and he reported it to the head of the presidential protection service, assuming that a formal report would follow. He also argued that he did not draw any salary from the game farm, and that it was something that he ran as a passion.But the panel said that Mr. Ramaphosa’s story had many gaps, and it cast doubt on whether the money stolen actually came from the sale of buffalo. The report said that the president may have violated the Constitution’s prohibition on public officials conducting private business, and that he also may have run afoul of anti-corruption laws that required him to report the theft to the police.The president’s allies have openly rejected the report’s findings, saying that they were based on speculation and there was nothing conclusive to suggest that the president had done anything wrong. His legal team was busy this weekend preparing a brief requesting that a judge review the report and throw it out.“It is in the long term interest and sustainability of our constitutional democracy and well beyond the Ramaphosa presidency that such a clearly flawed report is challenged,” Mr. Magwenya said.Even as Mr. Ramaphosa vows to forge ahead, he still faces a precarious fate. A.N.C. leaders are scheduled to meet on Sunday and Monday to discuss the report and decide what stance the organization will take toward its leader. On Tuesday, Parliament is set to debate the report’s findings, and analysts say it is likely that lawmakers will vote to convene an impeachment hearing.Mr. Ramaphosa would be removed from office if two-thirds of the members of Parliament, which is controlled by the A.N.C., vote against him. No South African president has faced an impeachment hearing — let alone been removed from office — since the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.ImageThe National Assembly building in Cape Town, South Africa on Friday. The Parliament last week released a report suggesting the president may have violated his oath of office.Credit...Nic Bothma/EPA, via ShutterstockAlthough Mr. Ramaphosa may well survive the impeachment process, he carries a tarnished reputation that may hamper his efforts to retain leadership of his party and help the A.N.C. retain a national electoral majority in the next elections in 2024.Mr. Ramaphosa came to power in the A.N.C. in 2017, and took over the presidency of the country the following year, after his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, was rocked by a wide range of corruption accusations.Mr. Ramaphosa set out to clean up institutions seen as corrupt, including the national prosecutor’s office and the national revenue service. In October, he unveiled several measures to fight corruption based on recommendations by a judicial commission that conducted a three-year investigation into public corruption, in which 300 witnesses were interviewed.Mr. Ramaphosa’s agenda at home and abroad endeared him to leaders around the world. He was sometimes unafraid to challenge what he perceived as the West’s paternalistic attitude toward Africa. He insisted Covid vaccines be manufactured on the continent, and that wealthy nations provide significant financial support for poorer countries to transition to cleaner energy sources.Still, at home he has always faced stiff headwinds, especially within his factionalized political party. He will have to navigate those divisions if he wants to hold onto power at the conference, which analysts predict will produce a tight battle for the A.N.C.’s top spot.A faction of the A.N.C. that consists of supporters of Mr. Zuma, the former president, have long argued that Mr. Ramaphosa has done little to carry out an agenda to help uplift the masses in a country where many people are unemployed and struggling to get by. They also have been skeptical of Mr. Ramaphosa’s anti-corruption agenda, accusing him of using it as a cover to sideline his detractors within the party.But Mr. Ramaphosa’s allies see him as a bulwark against the corruption that has been so prevalent in the A.N.C., that it has led to a significant dip in the party’s electoral support. They say that if Mr. Ramaphosa resigns, those motivated by enriching themselves off state resources could take over the party.One of the president’s supporters, Zamani Saul, the premier of the Northern Cape province, lauded Mr. Ramaphosa’s efforts to fight corruption, saying that he needed to win a second term “in order to complete his mission and put the country in the right direction.”“Many people,” Mr. Saul added, “have got confidence in him.”"
12,https://www.nytimes.com/article/peru-president-castillo-boluarte.html,"Peru has been convulsed in recent years by political turmoil, rapid turnovers of presidents and constant scandals and investigations. But this week has perhaps been one of the most tumultuous in the country’s recent history.On Dec. 7, Congress scheduled an afternoon vote on whether to impeach the president, Pedro Castillo, on corruption accusations. But Mr. Castillo, seeking to thwart the vote, announced the dissolution of Congress and the installation of an emergency government, in what was quickly condemned as a coup attempt.The move shocked even the president’s allies, and by day’s end, Mr. Castillo had been removed from office and was under arrest. Dina Boluarte, his vice president, became president, the first woman to lead Peru.But what initially seemed to be a sign of the resilience of a fragile democracy dissolved into unrest just days later as supporters of the former president staged attacks against police stations, airports and factories.On Wednesday, Peru’s defense minister declared ​​​​​a nationwide state of emergency as the government sought to control widespread violence​, an extraordinary measure even in a country accustomed to political upheaval and protest.Here is what we know so far.Who is Pedro Castillo?Mr. Castillo, 53, who was elected president last year, was born to parents who were illiterate farmers in an impoverished, rural region without sewerage and with a lack of access to health care and schools.Even after Mr. Castillo became a teacher, he farmed to supplement his income. He became a union activist, helping to organize a strike for better pay for teachers.During his election campaign last year, Mr. Castillo, a socialist, appealed to voters frustrated with the political establishment.ImageWhile running for president, Mr. Castillo, a leftist, cast himself as a clean break from the country’s corrupt past.Credit...Angela Ponce/ReutersHe ran on the slogan “No more poor people in a rich country” and promised to improve the country’s economy and reduce its chronic inequality. High poverty rates have worsened during the pandemic, rising by about 10 percent, one of the steepest increases not just in Latin America but in the world, according to Hugo Nopo, a senior economist at the World Bank.Though Mr. Castillo cast himself as a clean break from the country’s corrupt past, he quickly became embroiled in scandal once elected and failed to keep many of his promises.Why was he facing impeachment?For years, Peru has been hobbled by political corruption that has led to six presidents since 2016. Mr. Castillo’s tenure only worsened the sense of political dysfunction.He named five different cabinets and cycled through more than 80 ministers, some of whom lacked relevant skills or experience and faced investigations related to corruption, domestic violence and murder.Mr. Castillo himself was the target of six criminal investigations, including over accusations that he led a criminal organization to profit off government contracts and claims that he repeatedly obstructed justice.He denied the charges, and some of his supporters say that he was the victim of a concerted effort to reinstate the former ruling elites.Congress had tried to impeach Mr. Castillo twice before, and the third vote was planned after he earlier threatened to dissolve the body.ImageLawmakers applauded after verbally voting to remove Mr. Castillo from office in Lima.Credit...Guadalupe Pardo/Associated PressWhat happened when Mr. Castillo tried to suspend Congress?Soon after Mr. Castillo announced his decision to short-circuit Congress in a nationally televised address, the armed forces and the police rejected Mr. Castillo’s move, top government officials resigned in quick succession, law experts called his effort illegal and even the president’s former personal lawyer disavowed him. The United States also joined the chorus of dissent.Within hours, Congress voted to impeach him.Mr. Castillo was seen that afternoon leaving the presidential palace in a car that later entered a police station. As he was held there, Ms. Boluarte was sworn in as Peru’s new leader.Later that day, the prosecutor’s office said it had ordered his arrest on charges of rebellion. The police said he was being held at a naval base on the outskirts of Lima, the capital.Mr. Castillo has defended his actions and shown no regret in his few public appearances since his arrest. At his second court hearing, the former leader said that he had been unfairly detained and that he would “never resign.”Who is Peru’s new president?Ms. Boluarte, 60, is a former lawyer who was a member of a Marxist political party until she was pushed out last year after criticizing the party’s leader.She comes from a rural area of Peru, and she ran on Mr. Castillo’s ticket last year, serving as vice president and as his minister of development and social inclusion. She resigned from her ministerial role last month, after Mr. Castillo formed his most recent cabinet.ImagePeru’s new president, Dina Boluarte, leaving her home in Lima on Dec. 8.Credit...Martin Mejia/Associated PressWhat do the protesters want?After Ms. Boluarte took office on Dec. 7, small protests erupted in Lima and other parts of the country. They intensified that weekend when at least six people died in the clashes, according to Peru’s ombudsman’s office. Authorities said that more than 100 police officers have been injured.The protests are backed by the country’s largest federation of labor unions, the largest association of Indigenous people in the Peruvian Amazon and many organizations representing poor farmers, among other groups.Many of them are supporters of Mr. Castillo who say that they feel robbed of their vote. They have demanded the shut down of Congress, the drafting of a new Constitution and new elections. Some are also calling for Mr. Castillo’s release.Many accuse the political elite of driving him toward political suicide, and say the establishment never gave him a chance to govern successfully.So far, no single leader has emerged to unify the disparate groups.How has the government responded?The government of Peru on Wednesday declared a nationwide state of emergency. The measure suspended the rights of assembly and freedom of transit, among other civil liberties, for 30 days, said the country’s defense minister.Experts said that the state of emergency was unusual. While past governments have done so in parts of the country, they said the measure had not been used this widely since the 1990s, when the country was brutalized by a Marxist terrorist group called the Shining Path.What challenges does Peru face?A quarter of Peru’s 33 million people live in poverty. The United Nations in November warned that the country had the highest rate of food insecurity in South America, with half the population lacking regular access to sufficient nutrition.“The most important challenge is that of shared prosperity,” said Mr. Nopo, the World Bank economist. “We are a country that has been characterized by good macro stability, but it still has serious challenges in making this macro bonanza as inclusive as would be desirable.”The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have contributed to a huge increase in prices for basic goods and other essential products, including fertilizer, setting off widespread protests.Mining, a key part of the economy, has been a driver of the country’s growth over the past two decades, but it is also a major source of pollution and contributes to climate change.Chronic corruption has affected the highest echelons of power. Three presidents in recent years were forced from office after corruption accusations.ImageA wholesale market on the outskirts of Lima in June. This year, Peruvians have faced the country’s highest inflation in decades.Credit...Martin Mejia/Associated PressMr. Castillo is the sixth former president to face prison time this century, a symptom of institutional instability, and Congress is one of the least-trusted institutions in the country, according to a recent poll.Is this turmoil new for Peru?Even before Mr. Castillo, the country had a rapid succession of presidents facing prison time. Alberto Fujimori is serving time in prison; Ollanta Humala and his wife spent nine months in preventive prison; Pedro Pablo Kuczynski spent three years under house arrest; Alan García died by suicide moments before a prosecutor arrived to his home to arrest him; and Alejandro Toledo is awaiting extradition from the United States to face corruption charges.Mr. Castillo’s efforts to dismantle Congress also had echoes of the past.Thirty-two years ago, Mr. Fujimori, another anti-establishment outsider, was elected president. He came to power as hyperinflation ravaged Peru’s economy and left-wing rebel groups carried out terror campaigns during which tens of thousands of people were killed.Two years after his election, Mr. Fujimori staged a coup with the support of the military, suspended the Constitution and ruled as a dictator.During his government’s counterinsurgency campaign, dozens of civilians died in extrajudicial killings at the hands of death squads that prosecutors said Mr. Fujimori had created. He resigned in 2000.In 2009, Mr. Fujimori received a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses.His daughter Keiko Fujimori narrowly lost last year’s presidential election to Mr. Castillo.Elda Cantú and Mitra Taj contributed reporting."

He announced the dissolution of Congress and the installation of an emergency government, stunning political leaders across the spectrum, including his own allies, by effectively trying to carry out what was widely condemned as an attempted coup to cling to power.Government officials resigned en masse. The top court declared the move unconstitutional. And the country’s armed forces and the national police issued a joint statement suggesting they would not support him.By day’s end, Pedro Castillo, 53, was ousted from power and under arrest. Dina Boluarte, his vice president, was sworn in as president and became the first woman to lead Peru.It was a cinematic conclusion to Mr. Castillo’s presidency, the first leftist to be elected Peru’s president in more than a generation. The former farmer, teacher and union activist had campaigned last year on a pledge to transform the ailing economy and reverse the high rates of poverty among rural Peruvians, which had worsened during the pandemic.But his attempt to seize power echoed a similar move by former President Alberto Fujimori 30 years ago. Like Mr. Castillo, Mr. Fujimori was a populist outsider who was elected democratically in 1990. Two years later, he staged a coup to shut down Congress with the support of the military, and ruled as a dictator until 2000. He is now in prison on charges of corruption and human rights abuses.ImageMr. Castillo, whose administration had been hobbled by corruption charges, had survived two previous impeachment attempts.Credit...Martin Mejia/Associated PressBut Peru has continued to be convulsed by years of high-level corruption scandals resulting in six presidents since 2016. Twice before during Mr. Castillo’s 16 months in power Congress had tried to oust him, but failed to garner enough votes for an impeachment.Mr. Castillo was one of several leftists in Latin America who had been swept into power by votes disillusioned by the establishment, fed up with decades of inequality, high unemployment and an elite political class tainted by years of corruption and infighting.But he appeared uninterested in making good on his campaign promises and was quickly confronted by a cascading stream of obstacles that paralyzed his administration, including high-level corruption scandals, criminal investigations and cabinet turnover.Mr. Castillo churned through more than 80 ministers and filled many posts with political allies lacking relevant experience, some of whom have faced investigations for corruption, domestic violence and murder.Prosecutors accused him of leading a criminal organization with lawmakers and family members to profit off government contracts and of repeatedly obstructing justice, sometimes seemingly in plain view — such as when his daughter disappeared from the presidential palace as she faced arrest and his office later claimed that footage that would have captured the moment went missing.ImagePeru’s Congress on Wednesday, after Mr. Castillo dissolved the body just before lawmakers voted to impeach him and remove him from office.Credit...Martin Mejia/Associated PressThe president’s approval rating slumped to 19 percent in Lima, though in rural areas it remained at 45 percent, just four percentage points lower than a year ago, according to polls last month by the Institute of Peruvian Studies.Congress scheduled a third impeachment vote last week after Mr. Castillo threatened to dissolve Congress last month.It was just hours before that vote when Mr. Castillo announced the dissolution of Congress and the installation of an emergency government to rule by decree, while also imposing an immediate national curfew.“We have taken the decision to establish an emergency government, to reestablish the rule of law and democracy to which effect the following measures are dictated: to dissolve Congress temporarily, to install a government of exceptional emergency, to call to the shortest term possible to elections for a new Congress with the ability to draft a new Constitution,” Mr. Castillo said.Mr. Castillo’s declaration plunged the fragile democracy into its biggest political crisis in years. Twice, Congress had tried to oust Mr. Castillo from power, but failed to garner enough votes for an impeachment.ImagePolice officers standing guard as people gathered outside Congress on Wednesday.Credit...Sebastian Castaneda/ReutersBut it quickly became apparent that his announcement had little support, prompting the mass resignation of many of his top cabinet members, a fire hose of denunciations from political opponents and constitutional experts and a joint statement from the armed forces and the police suggesting that he lacked any legal right to carry out his decree.“We reject the breaking of constitutional order and we urge the population to respect the political constitution, remain calm and trust state institutions,” the police later said in a separate statement.The U.S. Embassy in Lima also condemned Mr. Castillo. “The United States emphatically urges President Castillo to reverse his attempt to close Congress and allow democratic institutions in Peru to work according to the constitution,” the embassy said in a tweet. “We encourage the Peruvian public to stay calm during this uncertain time.”The president’s declaration seemed to shock even Mr. Castillo’s closest allies.“I am a defender of the democratic order, of the Constitution and I am deeply convinced that politics cannot be above the law,” Benji Espinoza, who was the president’s personal lawyer until he resigned Wednesday, told RPP, a local radio station.ImageBurning images of Mr. Castillo in front of the police station where he was detained.Credit...Marco Garro for The New York TimesMr. Castillo had seemingly been considering such a move for some time. Last month, he publicly threatened to dissolve Congress and had quietly tried to survey military leaders about supporting him, according to local media outlets.After his defense minister resigned on Saturday, citing personal reasons, rumors of a military coup — in favor of and against Mr. Castillo — went viral on social media, leading some opposition lawmakers to stay the night in Congress on Sunday for fear of a violent attempt by the armed forces to close the chamber. No such attempt was made. By Tuesday, the head of Peru’s army had also resigned, citing personal reasons.On Wednesday, just two hours after Mr. Castillo’s announcement, Congress convened and voted to impeach the president. Lawmakers voted 101-6 with 10 abstentions to remove him from power.He was seen leaving the presidential palace in a car that later entered a police station, and on Wednesday night the prosecutor’s office said it had directed his arrest on charges of “rebellion.” The police later said that he would be held at the same prison where Mr. Fujimori is serving his sentence, at a naval base on the outskirts of Lima.Shortly after the congressional vote, Ms. Boluarte was sworn in as Peru’s new leader.“It is up to us to talk, to engage in dialogue, to reach agreements,” she said after she was sworn in before lawmakers who applauded and cheered her. “I ask for time to rescue our country from corruption and incompetence within the government.”ImageDina Boluarte, the vice president, was sworn in as president on Wednesday in Lima.Credit...Sebastian Castaneda/ReutersMs. Boluarte, 60, called for a truce between Peru’s political parties in order to reestablish national unity and return the country to a path of economic growth.A former lawyer and a member of a Marxist political party until she was pushed out last year for criticizing the party leader, Ms. Boluarte ran on Mr. Castillo’s ticket last year. She served as both his vice president and his minister of development and social inclusion, but resigned from the ministry after the president formed his last cabinet last month.Ms. Boluarte is not particularly well-known, and in a recent poll, Peruvians favored new general elections over her replacing Mr. Castillo in office in a scenario in which he was impeached.Former President Martín Vizcarra, the only Peruvian leader to be successfully ousted before Mr. Castillo, left office after the vote in 2020, but filed an appeal before the Constitutional Tribunal, which declined to weigh in on its legality.The next president lasted less than a week in office, and his successor governed Peru for the next eight months, until Mr. Castillo took office.Genevieve Glatsky contributed reporting from Bogotá, Colombia, and Elda Cantú from Mexico City."
14,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/us/kevin-mccarthy-impeach-mayorkas.html,"Facing a right-wing revolt against his campaign to become the next House speaker, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, on Tuesday visited the southwest border and called on Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Homeland Security secretary, to resign or face potential impeachment proceedings.At a news conference in El Paso, Mr. McCarthy, who has suffered defections in recent days from hard-right Republicans who have said they would not back him for speaker, accused Mr. Mayorkas of ignoring immigration laws and lying to Congress, citing the secretary’s assertions that the border is secure at a time when crossings are at a high.“If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure, and will determine whether we can begin an impeachment inquiry,” Mr. McCarthy said in front of a bank of television cameras.The threat was not a new one — Mr. McCarthy made a similar trip last spring and warned then that a G.O.P. Congress would consider impeaching Mr. Mayorkas — but it was a striking change in tone from a leader who had spent the weeks before the midterm elections playing down the possibility that Republicans would use their power to impeach President Biden or members of his administration.While Mr. McCarthy did not commit on Tuesday to following through on the threat to Mr. Mayorkas, he strongly hinted he was inclined to do so.More on U.S. ImmigrationNew Census Data: The number of immigrants nearly tripled in the nation’s 20 most populous counties from 2021 to 2022, but many still saw declines in population, the Census Bureau said.Attacking Mayorkas: Republicans in Congress, who are intent on hammering at President Biden’s immigration policies, have singled out Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, as a ripe target for condemnation.Free Speech Challenge: The Supreme Court is considering whether a federal law, which makes it a crime to encourage unauthorized immigrants to come to or stay in the United States, runs afoul of the First Amendment.“We never do impeachment for political purposes,” Mr. McCarthy said when asked what specific crimes the secretary may have committed. He added: “We know exactly what Secretary Mayorkas has done.”It reflected the pressure Mr. McCarthy is under from the extreme right of his party to use the House majority to aggressively attack the Biden administration. The dynamic has intensified in recent days, as right-wing Republicans have refused to support Mr. McCarthy for speaker, imperiling his chances of drawing the 218 votes he needs on the House floor to secure the top post.After a poorer than expected performance in the midterm elections, Republicans control just 219 House seats, with a handful of races still uncalled. They are on track to gain only a few more, giving Mr. McCarthy very little room for defections and leaving him looking for ways to placate members on his right flank.Representative Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona and a former chairman of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, has said that Mr. McCarthy does not have the votes needed to become speaker in a floor vote on Jan. 3. Mr. Biggs challenged Mr. McCarthy last week for the party’s nomination for the speakership. Mr. McCarthy prevailed, but the tally pointed to an uphill battle; he lost three dozen Republican votes.Several others have since publicly indicated they would not back Mr. McCarthy, including Representatives Matt Gaetz of Florida, Bob Good of Virginia, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who told Politico on Tuesday that he was a “hard” no and expected “many more” Republicans to take the same position. Immigration advocacy groups condemned Mr. McCarthy’s news conference on Tuesday as a political stunt.“Instead of a serious reckoning with their party’s underwhelming midterm results and real efforts to distance themselves from MAGA extremism and the violence it inspires, McCarthy’s trip is a sign they plan to double down and again push ugly and dangerous rhetoric about immigrants and the border,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, the director of America’s Voice.Before the elections, Mr. McCarthy said he had yet to see grounds for impeaching any Biden administration official, but hard-right members of his rank and file have been pressing to target the president and several members of his team including Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Mr. Mayorkas.Overall, 10 House Republicans have either introduced or sponsored a total of 21 articles of impeachment against Mr. Biden and his top officials since the start of the administration.In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, shrugged off Mr. McCarthy’s equivocation about impeachment.“I think people underestimate him, in thinking he wouldn’t do it,” she said, adding that a Speaker McCarthy would give her “a lot of power and a lot of leeway” in order to fulfill his job and “please the base.”Shortly afterward, Ms. Greene announced she would back Mr. McCarthy’s bid for speaker."
15,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/us/south-africa-president-cyril-ramaphosa-report.html,"JOHANNESBURG — As President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa hunkered down with advisers on Friday to discuss a damning corruption report against him, he snubbed a meeting of his party’s top leadership, prolonging the confusion and uncertainty of a corruption-weary public waiting to hear whether he will resign.Mr. Ramaphosa’s political future was thrown into turmoil after the report, by an independent panel, said he may have broken the law and violated the Constitution in his handling of a burglary, of a large sum of U.S. currency of unexplained origin, at his farm. The 80-person executive committee of the African National Congress, the governing party led by Mr. Ramaphosa, was scheduled to discuss the panel’s findings on Friday as rumors of Mr. Ramaphosa’s imminent resignation swirled.Instead, the party’s top brass filed into a conference venue in a convoy of luxury cars, only to adjourn within an hour without the president showing up. An adviser to Mr. Ramaphosa said he was not there because he was going to be the subject of discussion and wanted the members to be able to speak freely.The party’s treasurer general, Paul Mashatile, told journalists that A.N.C. members needed more time to consider the report and would meet again on Sunday. That meeting, which Mr. Ramaphosa is likely to attend if his A.N.C. colleagues advise him to, will decide what position the already divided party will take on its embattled president.Mr. Ramaphosa’s absence from the meeting hinted at a politically wounded leader. Before the damning report, Mr. Ramaphosa seemed poised to win a second term as A.N.C. president at the party’s national elective conference, which will be held in about two weeks. As president of the country, he had just wrapped up a visit to Buckingham Palace as the first head of state to visit King Charles III.ImageThe A.N.C. treasurer general, Paul Mashatile, after a party leadership meeting on Friday.Credit...Kim Ludbrook/EPA, via ShutterstockSouth Africa’s Parliament is scheduled to debate the report on Tuesday, and will vote on whether Mr. Ramaphosa must face an impeachment inquiry. While the panel of two former judges and a lawyer found that Mr. Ramaphosa abused his power and broke South Africa’s anti-corruption laws, the president’s allies believe he can mount a reasonable challenge against impeachment. The panel’s findings are not legally binding, and its scope was limited to documented evidence submitted. A full impeachment hearing could yet exonerate Mr. Ramaphosa, his allies said.“I think the president must fight back to get the matter to be clarified properly in the constitutional court or a court of law,” said Speed Katishi Mashilo, the deputy head of the A.N.C. in the Mpumalanga province.In the immediate aftermath of the report’s release, the president and his advisers focused their discussions on what the panel’s conclusions could mean for him, the government and the country, according to allies of Mr. Ramaphosa who were briefed on the discussions. But the focus would soon turn to what people in the president’s camp believed were flaws in the report and whether the president should challenge it, his allies said.Among the concerns that arose during the discussions was that if Parliament went ahead with an impeachment hearing, Mr. Ramaphosa would not be able to properly focus on running a country with a shrinking economy and an electricity crisis. The president considered several options — including challenging the report, allowing the impeachment process to play out or quitting — and some of his close confidants urged him not go the resignation route, allies said.A.N.C. leaders in support of Mr. Ramaphosa did the rounds on radio and television, while others started online petitions to urge the president to remain in office. A close friend of the president, James Motlatsi, a former trade union leader, said Mr. Ramaphosa considered resigning so that he could challenge the report “from outside.”“I said no, this is an attack to you,” Mr. Motlatsi, speaking in a radio interview, said he told Mr. Ramaphosa, urging him to remain in office.ImageA.N.C. members protest outside the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg, in July, to demand action be taken against Mr. Ramaphosa over an undisclosed theft at his farm.Credit...Themba Hadebe/Associated PressMr. Ramaphosa’s allies have framed the fallout from this report as not just a personal battle for Mr. Ramphosa, but a struggle over the moral ‌center of the‌‌ liberation movement, which is more than a century old. They say that if Mr. Ramaphosa g‌ives in to pressure, his loss will mean a victory for a faction within the A.N.C.‌ that they consider corrupt.“You cannot be told by a criminal to go,” Mr. Motlatsi recalled telling the president. The A.N.C. described the remarks as “insensitive and rather disappointing” and asked Mr. Motlatsi to retract his comment.Mr. Ramaphosa’s woes began when a political rival filed a criminal complaint against him, accusing him of hiding the theft of foreign currency from his private residence on his wildlife farm in South Africa’s Limpopo province. The political rival, Arthur Fraser, also accused Mr. Ramaphosa’s security detail of kidnapping the Namibian nationals accused of the theft. The panel’s inquiry was triggered by a charge from opposition politicians, who also accuse him of using his office to pressure the president of neighboring Namibia to ignore the matter.The panel found that Mr. Ramaphosa breached Parliament’s code of ethics and broke anti-corruption laws when he failed to report the crime to the police. It also cast doubt on Mr. Ramaphosa’s explanation for the source of the cash, and why it was stuffed into a sofa for safekeeping.The reaction to the panel’s findings and the political spectacle that has followed have created an air of uncertainty in South Africa. The currency, the rand, took a sharp dip. Church leaders weighed in, calling on the president to account to the public. On news channels and social media, the question of whether Mr. Ramaphosa will remain president has dominated the public conversation. People close to the president say he too was grappling with this question.“The most premature decision would be for President Ramaphosa to just step down,” Gwede Mantashe, the party’s chairman, said during a television interview.ImageSouth Africa’s Parliament is schedule to debate the report on Tuesday, and will vote on whether Mr. Ramaphosa must face an impeachment inquiry.Credit...Nic Bothma/EPA, via ShutterstockSome opposition parties joined the call for him to remain in office.“President Cyril Ramaphosa should not contemplate, nor be bullied into resigning on the basis of the untested findings,” said Brett Herron, a member of Parliament for the GOOD party.But Mr. Ramaphosa’s detractors were just as vocal, and continued to call for him to step down. They pointed to other A.N.C. leaders who were forced to step down while facing criminal accusations.Challenging the report in court would not necessarily halt Parliament’s impeachment process, but it would expose the limitations of the panel’s report and provide a possible lifeline for Mr. Ramaphosa, said Richard Calland, a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.“It will be important to surgically dissect the report to expose its fallibility,” Mr. Calland said. “It’s essential for the political credibility of his fight back.”"
16,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/world/africa/south-africa-president-cyril-ramaphosa.html,"JOHANNESBURG — The political future of South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, grew increasingly grim on Thursday as he huddled with advisers and his opponents lobbied loudly for his resignation a day after a report to Parliament said he may have broken the law in connection with a large sum of cash stolen from his game farm.The report by an independent panel, released on Wednesday, suggested that Mr. Ramaphosa face an impeachment hearing in Parliament to determine whether he should be removed from office. It cast heavy skepticism on his explanation of how a large sum of U.S. currency came to be hidden in — and stolen from — a sofa at his farm, Phala Phala Wildlife.“The president’s in a very, very terrible position,” said Sithembile Mbete, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Pretoria.The president’s detractors, who have long been lobbying for his ouster, used the report to buoy their argument that he lacks the moral authority to continue as the leader of the country and carry out the anti-corruption fight that has been his central talking point.“I think the President has to step aside now and answer to the case,” Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a member of Mr. Ramaphosa’s cabinet who is challenging him for leadership of their political party, the African National Congress, wrote on Twitter after the panel’s report was released.ImageNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in 2019.Credit...EPA, via ShutterstockThe president’s office said on Wednesday that Mr. Ramaphosa would address the nation in due course, and there were predictions in South African media that he would give a resignation speech on Thursday. But on Thursday evening, Mr. Ramaphosa’s spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, convened a brief news conference to say that the president was still pondering his future and would not speak that day.“All options are on the table,” he said.Mr. Ramaphosa was consulting a wide range of people across government, within his party and in other political parties to determine the best course forward. The president’s wide consultations align with his governing style — and is a point of criticism among detractors who say he consults to the point of indecision and paralysis.“Whatever decision the president makes, that decision has to be informed by the best interest of the country,” Mr. Magwenya said. “And that decision cannot be rushed.”The A.N.C. is scheduled to convene its national conference to elect its leaders in about two weeks. Until he was rocked by allegations of corruption, Mr. Ramaphosa had seemed in a comfortable position to win re-election as the party’s president, positioning him to win its backing to run for a second term in 2024.But in June, one of his political foes filed a complaint with the police alleging that between $4 million and $8 million in U.S. dollars was stolen from Mr. Ramaphosa’s game farm in February 2020. The complaint said he failed to report the theft to the police and attempted to cover it up in order to shield himself from allegations of tax fraud and money laundering associated with the cache of money, and from questions about its source.ImageMr. Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala Wildlife farm in Limpopo province, South Africa.Credit...Joao Silva/The New York TimesMr. Ramaphosa argued that only $580,000 had been stolen and that the money represented the proceeds of the sale of 20 buffaloes to a Sudanese businessman. He said he had broken no laws and that the money had been stashed in a couch because a manager at the farm worried that it could be stolen from a safe that several staff members could open.But the panel of two former judges and a lawyer reported that the president’s version of events had many holes, and that he had failed to account for why he did not report receiving foreign currency to South Africa’s central bank or pay taxes on it as required, or why he did not report the theft to the police. The panelists expressed doubt that the money actually came from the proceeds of the sale of buffaloes, which the claimed buyer apparently never took away from the farm.The National Assembly is scheduled to debate the panel’s findings next Tuesday, and political analysts say it is likely that lawmakers will vote to convene a committee to hold a hearing on whether Mr. Ramaphosa should be removed from office. The president would be removed if two-thirds of the members of Parliament vote against him.Ms. Mbete, the politics lecturer, said that Mr. Ramaphosa would likely survive an impeachment process because his party is in the majority. The panel’s findings are much more damaging to him within the context of the A.N.C.’s bitter internal power struggle.In some ways, the panel’s finding is a good sign for South Africa, she said — it shows that the country has resilient institutions that are unafraid to hold the powerful accountable. But it’s also bad in that it could cause the president to become consumed by party politics, she said.“People don’t eat institutions,” she said. “The issues of poverty, unemployment and inequality that are really urgent, it just feels like that’s going to be put on the back burner again.”Following the release of the panel’s findings, the president’s office released a statement denying any wrongdoing and saying that he would address the nation in due course. The president and his deputy, David Mabuza, both canceled public appearances on Thursday, and his spokesman canceled a news conference.ImageReading about the news in Cape Town on Thursday.Credit...Esa Alexander/ReutersThe A.N.C.’s national executive committee was slated to meet to discuss the panel report on Thursday evening, but the meeting was postponed until Friday morning. During a news conference at the party’s headquarters on Thursday afternoon to announce the candidates for the executive committee elections this month, the news about the president appeared to have party officials on edge.When reporters attempted to ask questions about Mr. Ramaphosa, the party’s spokesman shouted them down, waving his hand from a podium.The Democratic Alliance, the main opposition party in Parliament, called for a resolution to dissolve the government and hold elections early — they are currently scheduled for 2024.Lindiwe Zulu, the minister of social development and an executive in the A.N.C., said she could not make a judgment on her own about what the president’s future should hold. Although she did not support the president in the last A.N.C. leadership election, she said she had vowed to put her best foot forward when she was appointed to his cabinet. She appreciated some of the things he had been able to accomplish for the A.N.C. and the government, she said.So it all came as a shock when he was accused of corruption, she said — and even more so now, after the panel’s finding that he may, indeed, have broken the law.“I am disappointed,” she said. “And that’s all I can say.”"
17,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/krasner-impeached-pennsylvania.html,"On the brink of potentially losing their majority for the first time in more than a decade, Republicans in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly to impeach Larry Krasner, the progressive district attorney of Philadelphia, who has clashed with conservatives for years over his approach to crime.The 107-85 vote, mostly along party lines, was the result of an extraordinary — and likely futile — effort to remove the top elected law enforcement official in one of America’s largest cities during a lame-duck session, with control of the House still in the balance. Two razor-tight races that could tilt the chamber to Democrats remain uncalled after last week’s election.The House’s action will send the matter to the State Senate, which Republicans control — though not with the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict and remove Mr. Krasner, who won re-election last year to a second four-year term.“History will harshly judge this anti-democratic, authoritarian effort to erase Philly’s votes — votes by Black, brown and broke people in Philadelphia,” Mr. Krasner said in a statement after the vote on Wednesday. “And voters will have the last word.”The Senate, where enthusiasm for Mr. Krasner’s removal appears lower even among many Republicans, now finds itself in the unusual situation of determining whether and when to hold a trial, and is expected to caucus to determine next steps.“I am not aware of any precedents where this has happened, where there’s a lame duck, after-the-fact call up of impeachment,” said Stephen Ross, a law professor at Penn State University. “So this is somewhat unprecedented. And it is basically up to the Pennsylvania Senate to decide what the procedural rules are.”Shaakirrah Sanders, a visiting professor at Penn State Dickinson Law, said the State Constitution is not clear on what the Senate is required to do, especially since the current session ends this month. “It seems that would be way too quick to ensure the due process rights of the sitting district attorney,” she said.Mr. Krasner was first elected in 2017 as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors ushered into office across the country, amid growing public concerns about racism and over-incarceration in the U.S. criminal justice system. His office has drawn the ire of many conservatives by declining to prosecute some low-level offenses, such as drug possession and prostitution, and seeking more lenient sentences than his predecessors.Republicans have sought to blame Mr. Krasner for a surge of gun violence in Philadelphia over the past few years, a trend that was common in cities across the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, including those with more traditional prosecutors. In debate on the House floor on Wednesday, they charged him with “misbehavior in office.”“For one individual to completely set aside entire categories of law, as has been done in Philadelphia, is the height of the arrogance of power, and a complete undermining of the rule of law,” said Representative Timothy R. Bonner, a Republican who supported impeachment.More than 400 people have been killed in Philadelphia this year, and there have been more than 1,000 carjackings. Representative Martina White, a Republican who represents part of northeast Philadelphia, was the prime sponsor of the impeachment resolution, and last month accused Mr. Krasner of being “responsible for the rise in crime across our city.”The prosecutor easily won re-election last year with significant support from Black voters in the northern and western parts of the city — neighborhoods that have been the most affected by gun violence. According to his office, homicides in Philadelphia have declined by 5 percent from a year ago today, and crime rates are lower than in the 1990s.Democrats accused Republicans of abusing the impeachment process to damage Democrats running for office. “Impeachment now seems to be a measure that we’re using when we have a disagreement on public policy,” said Joanna E. McClinton, the House’s leading Democrat, whose district includes parts of Philadelphia, during the House session on Wednesday.Though no Pennsylvania lawmaker has been impeached in recent years, Republican lawmakers raised the prospect of trying to remove Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and threatened to impeach Philadelphia election officials for their management of ballot counting during the 2020 presidential election.In September, the House voted to hold Mr. Krasner in contempt for refusing to cooperate with a legislative committee investigating his possible impeachment. Mr. Krasner has accused the Republicans leading the committee of a lack of transparency, and of rushing the investigative process in an attempt to seek political points before the midterm elections.A committee of state lawmakers controlled by Republicans issued a report last month charging that Mr. Krasner had “contributed to a catastrophic rise in violent crime” with his pursuit of progressive criminal justice policies, but stopped short of calling for Mr. Krasner’s impeachment.House Republicans filed articles of impeachment days later, and a House committee approved them on Tuesday. Mr. Krasner has not been accused of any crime.Last week, Democrats in Pennsylvania performed better than expected in the midterm elections, and could still take control of the State House after all ballots are counted in two races in the Philadelphia suburbs.Campbell Robertson contributed reporting."

When she was sworn in as speaker in 2007, surrounded by the children of members of Congress, she became the first woman to serve in that post. And over the years, Ms. Pelosi was often photographed as the lone woman in rooms full of men, even after the ranks of Congress became more diverse.Throughout her career, Republicans have vilified her; she is now one of the most threatened members of Congress. She had a particularly toxic relationship with former President Donald J.

She repeated the move again in 2019 when she won the speaker’s gavel a second time.Understand the Events on Jan. 6Timeline: On Jan. 6, 2021, 64 days after Election Day 2020, a mob of supporters of President Donald J.

19,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/us/politics/alejandro-majorkas-house-republicans-border.html,"WASHINGTON — The Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, faced hostile questions about the southwest border from House Republicans on Tuesday, foreshadowing the kind of grilling he can expect more of from the G.O.P., which has threatened to impeach him should it take control of the House, as it is expected to do.The hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee, which was meant to address worldwide threats to the United States, included as witnesses Mr. Mayorkas; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; and Christine Abizaid, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. But it was not long before Republicans focused most of their attention on Mr. Mayorkas, with questions about the record-breaking number of illegal crossings at the southwestern border during the Biden administration.“Have you had discussions with the president or anyone in the Biden administration about stepping down from your current role?” Representative Jake LaTurner, Republican of Kansas, asked Mr. Mayorkas.The secretary said he had not, to which Mr. LaTurner said, “I hope for the sake of the safety of the American people that that conversation happens very soon.”One lawmaker, Representative Michael Guest, Republican of Mississippi, praised Mr. Mayorkas for forcing the head of Customs and Border Protection, Chris Magnus, to resign last week. But Mr. Guest added that he hoped more people would be fired.More on U.S. ImmigrationNew Census Data: The number of immigrants nearly tripled in the nation’s 20 most populous counties from 2021 to 2022, but many still saw declines in population, the Census Bureau said.Attacking Mayorkas: Republicans in Congress, who are intent on hammering at President Biden’s immigration policies, have singled out Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, as a ripe target for condemnation.Free Speech Challenge: The Supreme Court is considering whether a federal law, which makes it a crime to encourage unauthorized immigrants to come to or stay in the United States, runs afoul of the First Amendment.Republicans have been criticizing Mr. Mayorkas for the high number of illegal crossings and for taking Border Patrol agents off patrol duty to perform administrative work at government centers — an outcome of an outdated system that is ill-equipped to manage the current migration challenges.But the tone on Tuesday further solidified the expectation that Mr. Mayorkas would continue to hear the impeachment threats Republicans have been levying for months if they have the majority in the House next year.The Biden administration has struggled to manage the high volume of migrants, which has at times overwhelmed border officials and drawn criticism from Republicans over the president’s border policy. Mr. Biden came into office off a campaign that condemned the restrictive immigration policies of his predecessor. But the challenge of dealing with the steep increase in illegal crossings dashed early hopes for big changes to the system, and the number of people caught illegally crossing the border daily has remained high over the past year.On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security released its monthly statistics for October, which show that illegal crossings increased from the month before. In the 2022 fiscal year, border officials made more than 2.3 million apprehensions at the southwestern border, an increase over the previous year. Mr. Mayorkas said that an additional 600,000 people had crossed without detection in the same time period.Republicans have seized on the narrative of an unsecure border and tied it to Democrats’ policies, although former President Donald J. Trump also faced a surge in illegal crossings while he was in office. In fact, the latest migration trend is part of a global shift, with people fleeing poverty exacerbated by the pandemic, violence and unstable governments.Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, who has a history of tense exchanges with Mr. Mayorkas, asked a series of questions that appeared to lay the groundwork for a potential buffet of charges against Mr. Mayorkas. Because Democrats will continue to hold the majority in the Senate, it is not likely Mr. Mayorkas would ever be convicted even if a G.O.P.-led House were to impeach him.Mr. Higgins asked whether the secretary had tried to “suppress exculpatory evidence” regarding Customs and Border Protection employees who have come under public attack by the Biden administration. He also asked Mr. Mayorkas whether he had used his authority to punish homeland security agents identified as conservatives or supporters of Mr. Trump. Republicans have been building a similar argument against the attorney general, whom they have also said they want to impeach.Mr. Mayorkas attempted to answer Mr. Higgins, but the men mostly talked over each other. The secretary was able to interject a few words, and said he did not know what Mr. Higgins was referring to in some of his questions.When it comes to bringing impeachment charges, there is no legal standard to be met, said Stephen Griffin, a constitutional law expert at Tulane University’s law school. That means if Republicans win control of the House, they can start the process once the new Congress is in session.But Representative Kevin McCarthy, who won his party’s nomination for speaker on Tuesday even as it awaits word that it has gained control of the House, has shown some reluctance to use impeachment proceedings for political purposes. Republicans were critical of the two Democrat-led impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.Professor Griffin said that in a clear case of wrongdoing by a cabinet official, “any administration can easily avoid the embarrassment of impeachment simply by getting rid of the official.”Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached — William Belknap, in 1876. Mr. Belknap was secretary of war in the Grant administration. He was accused of accepting bribes.Luke Broadwater contributed reporting."
20,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/nyregion/giuliani-federal-charges-lobbying.html,"Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said on Monday that they would not bring charges against Rudolph W. Giuliani in a long-running investigation into whether he violated lobbying laws. In a brief letter to the judge overseeing a review of materials seized during a search of Mr. Giuliani’s home and office last year, the prosecutors wrote that “based on information currently available to the government, criminal charges are not forthcoming.”The decision deals a major victory to Mr. Giuliani, Donald J. Trump’s onetime personal lawyer and the former mayor of New York. Mr. Giuliani decades ago headed the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which conducted the investigation with the F.B.I.“Having seen all the evidence, I’m not at all surprised,” said Robert J. Costello, Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, while adding that he was “very grateful” to the prosecutors for publicly announcing their decision.The U.S. attorney’s office and the F.B.I. declined to comment on the conclusion of the investigation, which was focused on whether Mr. Giuliani illegally lobbied the Trump administration on behalf of Ukrainian officials. Those same Ukrainians helped Mr. Giuliani impugn Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was then on his way to becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. The prosecutors’ decision to close the investigation without an indictment signifies the end of a sprawling legal and political saga that enveloped the United States and Ukraine, an ally. It upended Mr. Giuliani’s already unsteady reputation as a lawman and compounded pressures on Mr. Trump’s inner circle. The move comes months after The New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani was unlikely to face charges. Although prosecutors had enough evidence last year to persuade a judge to order the seizure of Mr. Giuliani’s electronic devices, they did not uncover definitive proof of wrongdoing in the records, The Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.Mr. Giuliani’s legal troubles are not behind him, however. He also faces federal and Georgia state investigations into his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results on behalf of Mr. Trump, and his law license has been suspended in New York for making false statements about the election.A spokesman for Mr. Giuliani nonetheless suggested that the decision by the Southern District prosecutors indicated that his client had done no wrong.“The mayor has been completely and totally vindicated,” the spokesman, Ted Goodman, said in a statement.While the investigation into Mr. Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine began more than three years ago, it reached a turning point in April 2021, when federal investigators seized cellphones and computers from his Manhattan apartment and office. It was not only an escalation of the long-running inquiry but an extraordinary step to take against a lawyer, let alone one who had represented a sitting president.The investigation grew out of a case against two Soviet-born men who helped Mr. Giuliani pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Mr. Trump’s rivals, including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The prosecutors charged the men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, with unrelated crimes in 2019. Mr. Parnas, who turned on Mr. Giuliani and offered to provide evidence against him, was convicted at trial last year on campaign finance-related offenses and sentenced to 20 months in prison. Mr. Fruman pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes and was sentenced to a year and a day. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Learn more about our process.On Monday, Mr. Parnas’s lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, criticized the decision not to charge Mr. Giuliani. “There has long been a criminal justice disparity in our country, which protects the elite,” he said, and “it comes as no surprise that Rudy Giuliani, the former U.S. attorney, mayor and president’s lawyer, will not be charged.” At the heart of the investigation was Mr. Giuliani’s role in pushing the Trump administration to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump recalled her in May 2019, a move that was a focus of his first impeachment trial. Prosecutors examined whether there was a quid pro quo: removing the ambassador in return for information about the Biden family that would benefit Mr. Trump. Yuriy Lutsenko, a Ukrainian official, had butted heads with Ms. Yovanovitch, who had taken aim at corruption in the nation’s law enforcement and government. Federal prosecutors scrutinized Mr. Giuliani’s dealings with Mr. Lutsenko, who helped Mr. Giuliani and his associates as they tried to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden and push for Ms. Yovanovitch’s removal. Mr. Giuliani had discussions about taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting business from Mr. Lutsenko, but ultimately turned it down. Prosecutors suspected Mr. Giuliani was working not only for Mr. Trump at the time but also for Ukrainian officials who wanted the ambassador dismissed, people briefed on the matter told The Times last year. It is a federal crime to influence or lobby the United States government at the direction of a foreign official, business or citizen without disclosing it to the Justice Department. At least one of the search warrants for Mr. Giuliani’s devices specified that among the possible crimes he committed were violations of that law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Prosecutions under the lobbying law increased dramatically during Mr. Trump’s presidency, driven in part by a Justice Department directive to enforce such laws more rigorously. But prosecutors have struggled to convince judges and juries that the conduct charged in these cases amounted to federal crimes. Earlier this month, a jury acquitted Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a businessman and close adviser to Mr. Trump, on charges that he served as an agent of the United Arab Emirates. The search warrants against Mr. Giuliani were subject to a political battle. In the final months of the Trump administration, senior Justice Department officials repeatedly sought to block the Manhattan federal prosecutors from securing them. They cited concerns, including that the search would be conducted too close to the 2020 election, The Times reported last year. After the search warrants were executed in 2021, prosecutors and Mr. Giuliani’s lawyers recommended that Barbara S. Jones, a former judge in Manhattan, be appointed to review the materials seized by the F.B.I. in the searches of Mr. Giuliani’s home and office. Ms. Jones had played a similar role in the 2018 review of materials seized by authorities in the investigation of another former lawyer for Mr. Trump, Michael D. Cohen.Prosecutors’ request for a “special master” reflected concerns about “unusually sensitive privilege issues” raised by searches of a lawyer for a former president. On Monday, as part of an unrelated civil case that the New York attorney general recently filed against the Trump Organization, a judge, Arthur F. Engoron, named Ms. Jones as the company’s independent monitor. "
21,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/28/us/politics/house-republicans-impeachment-biden.html,"WASHINGTON — Since the day President Biden took office, Republicans have publicly called for his impeachment, introducing more than a dozen resolutions accusing him and his top officials of high crimes and misdemeanors and running campaign ads and fund-raising appeals vowing to remove the president from office at the first opportunity.But in the homestretch of a campaign that has brought the party tantalizingly close to winning control of Congress, top Republicans are seeking to downplay the chances that they will impeach Mr. Biden, distancing themselves from a polarizing issue that could alienate voters just as polls show the midterm elections breaking their way.“I think the country doesn’t like impeachment used for political purposes at all,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told Punchbowl News earlier this month. While he didn’t rule out moving forward on impeachment hearings if something rose “to that occasion,” Mr. McCarthy said the country needed to “heal” and that voters wanted to “start to see the system that actually works.”Still, should he become House speaker, Mr. McCarthy would be under immense pressure from hard-right members of his rank and file — and from core Republican voters who swept his party into the majority in part based on promises to take down Mr. Biden — to impeach. The pressure will only increase if former President Donald J. Trump adds his voice to those pushing for the move.It is just one of a series of confounding issues Mr. McCarthy would face as speaker, testing his grip on power and bearing heavy consequences for Mr. Biden and the country.“There have already been impeachment articles, and I expect you’ll get more of that in the next Congress,” said former Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia. “There’s certainly going to be pressure for this to go.”Some influential Republicans have been moving aggressively toward impeachment for years, demanding punishment for Mr. Biden and his administration as well as vengeance for Democrats’ two impeachments of Mr. Trump.“Joe Biden is guilty of committing high crimes and misdemeanors,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, wrote in a recent fund-raising email. “And it’s time for Congress to IMPEACH, CONVICT, and REMOVE Biden from office.”Ms. Greene has already introduced five articles of impeachment against Mr. Biden, including one the day he took office, when she accused him of abusing his power while serving as vice president to benefit his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine.ImageRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene has already introduced five articles of impeachment against Mr. Biden, including one the day he took office.Credit...Brittany Greeson for The New York TimesPrivately, many Republican lawmakers and staff members concede that there does not appear to be any clear-cut case of high crimes and misdemeanors by Mr. Biden or members of his cabinet that would meet the bar for impeachment.The Biden PresidencyPreparing for 2024: President Biden is beginning to sharpen his political message ahead of an expected re-election bid, warning that a strong economy could be weakened under Republican leadership.A Blunt Admission: A day after an assailant killed six people at a school in Nashville, the president declared himself powerless to respond to the scourge of gun violence in America.Defending Democracy: The Biden administration’s defense of global democracies is being tested by a political crisis in Israel and setbacks to democracy in other countries closely allied with the United States.But Mr. McCarthy has hardly rejected the prospect. Pressed recently on whether Mr. Biden or any officials in his administration deserved to be impeached, he said, “I don’t see it before me right now.”The response reflected an awareness that impeachment — as commonplace as it has become — is deeply unpopular. A national University of Massachusetts Amherst poll released in May showed that 66 percent of voters oppose impeachment, including 44 percent who said they strongly oppose the move.One of the concerns Democrats have expressed about electing a Republican majority in the House is that it would result in gridlock and dysfunction.“Nothing symbolizes that more than the idea of a whole-cloth impeachment of President Biden,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.Still, many Republican lawmakers and candidates likely to be elected to the House next month have been running on the issue, creating a groundswell of pressure for Mr. McCarthy, who would need their votes to become speaker.“I say if you’re the commander in chief and you invite an invasion on our southern border, if you’re the commander in chief and you leave Americans on the battlefield in Afghanistan to fall into the hands of the Taliban, what are we supposed to do with you?” Joe Kent, a Republican and 2020 election denier running for a House seat in Washington, said in a radio interview. “This is exactly why we have the ability to impeach presidents.”How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers.

This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Learn more about our process.Representative Claudia Tenney, Republican of New York, ran a television advertisement over the summer calling for impeachment proceedings against Mr. Biden. “Whether it is Joe Biden’s dereliction of duty at the southern border or his disastrous retreat in Afghanistan, I have called for Joe Biden to answer to the American people in impeachment hearings,” Ms. Tenney says in the ad.Overall 10 House Republicans have either introduced or sponsored a total of 21 articles of impeachment against Mr. Biden and his top officials since the start of the administration.The charges include a broad variety of offenses, including a failure to enforce immigration laws, a botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and the extension of a moratorium on residential evictions. In addition to a dozen against Mr. Biden, there is a single article against Vice President Kamala Harris; two each against Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary; and four against Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Ms. Greene shrugged off Mr. McCarthy’s equivocation about impeachment.“I think people underestimate him, in thinking he wouldn’t do it,” she said, adding that a Speaker McCarthy would give her “a lot of power and a lot of leeway” in order to fulfill his job and “please the base.”Democrats, too, assume that Mr. McCarthy will not be able to resist the pressure to impeach Mr. Biden — all the more so if Mr. Trump is running for president in 2024 and wants what he sees as retribution for his two impeachments. The White House has spent months preparing for the possibility.The challenge Mr. McCarthy faces is similar to the one that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, confronted during the 2018 midterm election campaign, when a small but vocal group of progressives was demanding Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Back then, she and other leading Democrats toiled to avoid publicly talking about the subject, wary of distractions from their message that could alienate independent voters and cost them their chance at winning control of the House.The task grew more difficult after they won; immediately after she was sworn in to Congress in 2019, for instance, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, told supporters “we’re going to impeach” Mr. Trump, using an expletive to refer to him.Even after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, documented multiple instances of obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, House Democrats were cautious about pursuing impeachment. It took nine months to get Ms. Pelosi on board.“People can be very critical of Biden on political or policy grounds,” said Norman L. Eisen, who served as a lawyer for Democrats during the first impeachment of Mr. Trump. “But those are not high crimes and misdemeanors — not even close. If it’s politically difficult to do impeachment when you have compelling proof of multiple high crimes, how much more so when there’s no evidence of constitutional crimes?”It can also be politically risky, if past impeachments are any guide. The impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 backfired badly on House Republicans, making Mr. Clinton more popular than at any other time of his presidency; Democrats picked up five seats in the House that fall.ImagePresident Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 backfired on Republicans and lifted Mr. Clinton’s popularity.Credit...Susan Walsh/Associated PressNewt Gingrich, the House speaker who quit Congress after Mr. Clinton’s impeachment amid ethics allegations and Republican losses, said he was advising Mr. McCarthy against it.“All you have to do is say to people, ‘Kamala Harris,’” Mr. Gingrich said. “Tell me the endgame that makes any sense. As bad as Biden is, she’d be vastly worse. I don’t think the brand-new Republican majority should waste their time on a dead end.”Karl Rove, the Republican strategist and the founder of a constellation of Republican fund-raising groups, also said the party would want to focus on other priorities.“Most Republican members are going to say: ‘Really? We’re going to waste our time and energy on this when there’s no chance in hell of two-thirds of the Senate voting to convict?’” Mr. Rove said. “Instead of combating inflation, freeing up American energy, fighting the wokeness, we’re going to engage in this?”It takes a majority in the House to impeach a president, but two-thirds in the Senate to convict and remove one from office.Representative Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who is in line to be the chair of the Judiciary Committee if his party wins control of the House, has floated the possibility of impeachment but more recently has taken a less committal stance.“That’s a call for the committee, for Republicans on the committee, in consultation with the entire conference,” he said in a recent interview.Asked whether Republican voters were demanding impeachment, Mr. Jordan said: “Voters are demanding the facts and the truth.”"
22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/us/larry-krasner-philadelphia-impeachment.html,"Republicans in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives filed articles of impeachment on Wednesday against Larry Krasner, the unabashedly progressive district attorney of Philadelphia, charging that he had been “derelict in his obligations” to prosecute crimes in a city struggling with a spike in gun violence.In a news conference, State Representative Martina White, a Republican who represents part of northeast Philadelphia and is the prime sponsor of the impeachment resolution, accused Mr. Krasner of being “responsible for the rise in crime across our city,” saying that he had “tipped the scales of justice in favor of criminals.”The articles were filed two days after a legislative committee issued a report castigating Mr. Krasner’s nearly five-year tenure as district attorney, but not recommending impeachment. The committee, charged with investigating how laws are enforced in Philadelphia, has not completed its work. But at the news conference, State Representative Kerry Benninghoff, the House majority leader, said the duty of the legislature was “to not stick our head in the sand like a lot of other people and do nothing and hope this suddenly gets better.”This first step in the impeachment process, coming on the last scheduled legislative day before the midterm elections, had been anticipated and condemned as “a political stunt” by Mr. Krasner last week.“Part of the Republican playbook, as you well know, is to point a finger at large, diverse cities and say, ‘Large, diverse cities are lawless,’” Mr. Krasner told reporters on Friday, saying that lawmakers seeking to impeach him were trying “to erase Philadelphia’s votes” and attributing the move to a “superheated election cycle.”His office declined to comment on Wednesday. Crime has become a central focus of Republican campaigns around the country, particularly in the critical contest for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. The Republican candidate, Dr. Mehmet Oz, has repeatedly accused his Democratic opponent, John Fetterman, of being “soft on crime,” and has at times tried to tie Mr. Fetterman to Mr. Krasner.ImageSouth and South Third Streets in Philadelphia, where three people were killed and 12 wounded in a shootout in June.Credit...Dakota Santiago for The New York TimesImpeachment is rare in Pennsylvania, but the threat of it less so. Republican lawmakers in recent years have raised the prospect of impeaching Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and Philadelphia election officials for how they handled the counting of ballots.Republican state lawmakers have talked about impeaching Mr. Krasner since the beginning of the year, an effort that became official in June, when several announced that they were starting the process. Two weeks later, they created the House Select Committee on Restoring Law and Order, which issued the report on Monday.If the House, where Republicans hold a significant majority, votes to impeach Mr. Krasner, the next step would be for the State Senate to hold a trial. The state Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict, which would entail at least five Democrats and an independent joining all of the Senate Republicans.The drive to impeach Mr. Krasner is the latest salvo between conservative state governments and a growing cadre of liberal district attorneys, who have been elected and re-elected promising to make changes like ending cash bail or decriminalizing low-level offenses. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended an elected prosecutor who publicly vowed not to prosecute those seeking abortion and removed another from a high-profile case because of her opposition to the death penalty. Republican state officials and lawmakers have made efforts to curb the authority of progressive prosecutors in Georgia, Missouri and Virginia as well.Over the past few years, gun violence has risen sharply in Philadelphia, as it has in cities and even small towns across the country. More than 400 people have been killed in Philadelphia this year so far, and there have been more than 1,000 carjackings. The city has tried a range of solutions, including curfews and funding for community groups.But many local politicians and community activists say that an explosion in the number of guns in the city is a driving factor; Pennsylvania judges and Republican state lawmakers have repeatedly blocked attempts by Philadelphia to adopt stricter local gun laws.Mr. Krasner has argued that focusing heavily on illegal gun possession, which the police in the city have been making arrests for in record numbers, does little to reduce violence. At the same time, he has said, it takes resources away from investigating more serious crimes, including murders, a majority of which go unsolved.Mr. Krasner’s approach has led to some friction with other city leaders. Philadelphia’s police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, said in a recent statement that the police were repeatedly arresting people with “extensive criminal histories,” and that “the question needs to be asked as to why they were yet again back out on the street.” The House included her statement in the articles of impeachment.ImagePolice Commissioner Danielle Outlaw of Philadelphia, center, spoke at a news conference after two police officers were shot on the parkway during a fireworks celebration in July.Credit...Steven M. Falk/The Philadelphia Inquirer, via Associated PressThe report that the House committee issued on Monday included data showing that the number of illegal gun possession cases ending in convictions had fallen significantly in Philadelphia, with a much higher proportion being withdrawn or dismissed there than in most other places in the state. Mr. Krasner has attributed this decline in large part to the failure of witnesses to show up in court.In the city itself, even some of those who have grown critical of Mr. Krasner found little satisfaction in Wednesday’s announcement.“There are far less people being prosecuted for what they did, and the city is in terrible, terrible straits,” said Rita O’Brien, 67, a Democrat, who was on her way into a neighborhood supermarket in north Philadelphia. But just as they have on gun laws, she said, state lawmakers were trying to inject themselves into matters that should be left to the city.“The Republicans have overstepped in a big way,” Ms. O’Brien said.The articles of impeachment charge that Mr. Krasner’s office has dismissed dozens of experienced prosecutors, instituted polices of declining to charge people arrested for certain crimes and seeking low sentences in others, and abused its discretion in certain specific cases.The first article of impeachment charges that Mr. Krasner’s approach to enforcing laws rose to the level of the “misbehavior in office,” which the state Constitution cites as a basis for impeachment. The second article charges him with having “obstructed the efforts” of the legislative committee, recounting the months of battles between the committee and Mr. Krasner’s office, including a lawsuit challenging the committee itself and a vote by the House finding Mr. Krasner in contempt for not complying with a subpoena.Not all members of the House committee apparently knew that the announcement of impeachment was coming today, with State Representative Danilo Burgos, one of the two Democrats on the five-person committee, telling a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday that it was “starting to look like it’s been their plan all along to undermine the electoral process of the voters of Philadelphia.”State Senator Nikil Saval, whose district includes part of Philadelphia, said that while views of Mr. Krasner varied widely among his fellow Democrats, it was unlikely that many of them would agree to remove him from office, especially since he won re-election last year with nearly 70 percent of the vote.“If you simply are the majority party, and you disapprove of a particular county official’s way of doing their job and you gin up an impeachment process to remove them — they could do that to anyone,” he said. “It’s existential at that point.”Jon Hurdle contributed reporting from Philadelphia."
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/us/elections/liz-cheney-midterm-election-results.html,"Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming who was ousted in her primary after being a steadfast and vocal critic of former President Donald J. Trump, called the losses by far-right candidates in the midterm elections a “clear victory for team normal.”Ms. Cheney made the comments on Thursday at the Anti-Defamation League’s Never is Now summit on antisemitism and hate in New York City, where she was asked to assess the results of the election.“I think that you saw in really important races around the country people coming together to say, ‘We believe in democracy. We believe in standing up for the Constitution and for the republic,’ and a real rejection of the toxicity and the hate and the vitriol and of Donald Trump,” Ms Cheney said.Republicans entered the midterms with heightened expectations that the party’s candidates were poised to create a red wave, seizing on high inflation, the issue of crime and President Biden’s weak approval ratings.But that level of success failed to materialize for the party, which has a chance at narrowly winning control of the House but could also fall short of flipping the Senate after several Trump-backed candidates lost key races. Control of both chambers is unclear as ballots are tallied in several too-close-to-call races.Ms. Cheney overwhelmingly lost in the Republican primary in August to her Trump-backed opponent, Harriet Hageman, who was elected on Tuesday to Wyoming’s lone House seat with nearly 70 percent of the vote.Mr. Trump’s supporters have vilified Ms. Cheney and nine other House Republicans who voted for Mr. Trump’s impeachment last year. One of them was re-elected on Tuesday and results are still being tallied for another. Ms. Cheney and three others lost in the primary, while four declined to seek another term.Ms. Cheney, who serves as vice chairwoman of the Jan. 6 committee, crossed party lines to support three Democrats in Tuesday’s elections. Two of the Democrats she backed, Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, won, while the third, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, lost his Senate race to J.D.

24,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/08/us/politics/alexander-vindman-giuliani-trump-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by Alexander S. Vindman, a chief witness in President Donald J. Trump’s first impeachment trial, against Donald Trump Jr., Rudolph W. Giuliani and two other top Trump allies, saying that Mr. Vindman had failed to prove that they had conspired to intimidate and retaliate against him.In the lawsuit, filed in February, Mr. Vindman said the defendants had spread false claims that he was a Ukrainian spy, had leaked classified information to undermine his credibility, falsely accused him of perjury and had him and his twin brother fired from their White House positions, leaving “a stain on our democracy.”But in a 29-page ruling, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington said that while the attacks against Mr. Vindman may have been “outside the bounds of appropriate political discourse,” the “political hackery alone” did not violate the law.“Vindman’s facts do not plausibly suggest that defendants agreed to intimidate him so as to prevent him from testifying or doing his job, or to unlawfully retaliate against him,” Judge Boasberg said, let alone that they had engaged in illegal conduct to do so.Mr. Vindman was an Army officer serving on the National Security Council in 2019 when Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of his political rival Joseph R. Biden Jr., while the United States was withholding military aid to Ukraine.In dramatic testimony during Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, Mr. Vindman, whose family fled Ukraine when he was 3, said he was so alarmed by Mr. Trump’s conduct that he reported it to his superiors.The February lawsuit cited various public statements and Twitter posts by Mr. Trump’s confidants and allies in the news media that attacked Mr. Vindman around the time of his testimony before House impeachment investigators. The suit accused the Trump allies of leaking information about an interaction between Mr. Vindman and a top Ukrainian national security official that conservative news outlets used to paint him as disloyal to the United States.Besides Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, and Mr. Giuliani, his former personal lawyer, the two other defendants in the lawsuit were Dan Scavino Jr., Mr. Trump’s longtime aide, who had control over Mr. Trump’s Twitter account; and Julia Hahn, a White House aide who had worked at Breitbart News. Mr. Trump was not named as a defendant.Mr. Vindman retired from the military in 2020 after he was made a colonel, a promotion Mr. Trump and his aides tried to block. At the time, Mr. Vindman’s lawyer said he was retiring after suffering “through a campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation.”Judge Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, acknowledged that Mr. Vindman had been “dragged into a media firestorm,” but said his ruling did not assess the validity of the attacks on Mr. Vindman."
25,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/opinion/donald-trump-impeachment.html,"In September of 2006, nearly six years into the presidency of George W. Bush, 29 percent of voters — nearly all Democrats — thought that he should be impeached.Similarly, in November, 2014, six years after Barack Obama won office, 30 percent of voters — mostly Republicans — thought that he, too, deserved that fate.President Trump, reached the 30 percent level in February 2017, one month into his presidency, the Public Religion Research Institute found.That after six years three in ten voters favored the impeachment of Bush and Obama was a reflection of the depth of polarization in the country. The speed at which Trump reached that number is something else altogether.A May 16 survey by Public Policy Polling, a partisan Democratic firm generally rated as credible, found that the pro-impeachment numbers for Trump had shot up to 48 percent, with 41 percent opposed.What does the future hold?As long as Republicans and Democrats are “pulling with roughly equal force,” Nate Silver observes at the website FiveThirtyEight,Trump isn’t going to be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate. But if something snaps — if Republicans have reason to think Trump has become a liability even in red states — look out.Although Democrats are by no means unified on the issue, much of the activist base of the Democratic Party smells blood. At least 23 House Democrats and three Senators have signaled that they are receptive to impeachment, most prominently Representatives Al Green of Texas and Maxine Waters of California, who have called for the start of formal proceedings. Matthew Yglesias, a liberal columnist, wrote “The case for impeaching Trump — and fast” on May 22 on Vox. Brian Buetler wrote in the New Republic on the same day, “Democrats Should Proudly Call for Trump’s Impeachment.”The subhead on the Yglesias essay reads “This is the exact situation impeachment was meant for. Let’s hurry up.” Yglesias goes on:A slow, ugly, painful divorce only means that Trump’s sins will more and more become the sins of the entire party, and impeachment will look like less and less of an appropriate remedy for wrongdoing that can only be redeemed by a broad and deep electoral landslide.Buetler, in turn, favorably quotes Waters, who disagrees with those who say that it is too early to begin impeachment proceedings: “No. We can’t wait that long. We don’t need to wait that long. He will have destroyed this country by then.”So far, these arguments have not been persuasive to top Democrats in the House and Senate. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, told reporters at her regular press briefing last week:I hope some would curb their enthusiasm until we have all of the facts and have confidence that when the American people understand what is there, whether it’s grounds for impeachment or grounds for disappointment, then they’ll know.Similarly, Dick Durbin, the Senate Democratic whip, told reporters that he has “been talking to the base since November the 9th and telling them this is a marathon, it’s not a sprint.” He went on:We have an orderly process in our government. We’re going to follow it. They don’t like to hear it, but I think that’s the facts.The caution displayed by Pelosi and Durbin is widely shared among Democratic elites.Robert Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University, was more explicit in an email:At present the case for impeaching the President is constitutionally insufficient and politically dangerous for Democrats. That is, most Republicans and weak and strong supporters of the President would believe impeachment at this time to be solely political in origin.Stein continued:Under these conditions impeachment would be framed by the President, his supporters and Congressional Republicans as a coup d’état to reverse the outcome of the 2016 election and the policies on which President Trump and the Republican Party campaigned.The real test for impeachment, Stein argues,is if new information from the special prosecutor or Trump himself erodes support among those who voted for him in 2016.A tiny faction of House Republicans — Justin Amash of Michigan, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Walter Jones of North Carolina — has warned that the sum of the allegations against Trump, if proven true, could be grounds for impeachment.A House vote to impeach the president requires a simple majority, 218 votes. Given the current composition of the House, 25 Republicans would have to join the 193 Democrats to impeach Trump and of course that calculation assumes Democratic unanimity, which is far from certain.The proceedings would then move to the Senate, which must decide whether to convict the president in what amounts to a trial, with the Senate serving as jury. Since a conviction requires that at least two thirds of the Senate, 67 members, vote in the affirmative, at least 19 Republican Senators would have to join the 48 members of the Democratic caucus for the conviction to stand.And let’s not forget that Democratic Senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota — all up for re-election in states that voted for Trump — would be wary of supporting impeachment.There are huge political hurdles for any Republican considering a bid to remove the president.In conversations and via email, Robert Jones, the C.E.O. of P.R.R.I., provided data showing how difficult it would be for Republican members of the House and Senate to support impeachment.Republican voters include three overlapping constituencies that provided strong support to Trump, Jones said:43 percent are white working class; 32 percent are white evangelical Protestants; and 15 percent identify with the Tea Party.Overall, 62 percent of Republicans “belong to at least one of these groups.”In other words, nearly two thirds of Republican voters are from constituencies that gave Trump his deepest levels of support.Jones noted that the 62 percent figure iscertainly a conservative estimate of the number of people within the GOP who could potentially be susceptible to “deep state” conspiracy explanations in the wake of a theoretical Trump impeachment.Jones also pointed out thateven if we discount this number as too large, it’s not a wild exaggeration to say that the GOP establishment could be facing nearly half of their base supporters at least seriously entertaining the idea that they were complicit in a coup to remove a legitimately elected president.If Congress were to launch impeachment proceedings, there could be a conservative backlash.For example, the Nixon impeachment and the multiple scandals associated with Watergate produced only a short term gain for Democrats. In 1974, Democrats picked up 49 House and four Senate seats. In 1976, Georgia’s Democratic governor, Jimmy Carter, won the presidency by a slim 50.1 to 48.0 percent over Gerald Ford, while his party gained just one House seat.The ascendance of the conservative movement continued unabated, steadily gaining strength from the late 1960s into the early 1990s. As the Watergate revelations faded into memory, conservatism revived with a vengeance.In 1978, Republicans picked up 15 House seats and 3 in the Senate. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected President, Republicans gained a majority in the Senate, and, in coalition with conservative Democrats, largely from the South, a working majority in the House.For Democrats pressing impeachment now, success could add energy to renewed mobilization of conservative populists, convinced that an elite establishment has sold them down the river.The reaction to a tweet on May 20th by Dinesh D’Souza, a prominent conservative writer and filmmaker, demonstrated the intensity of hard right opposition to even the suggestion of impeachment. The tweet:The response, more than 902 replies and 4,574 retweets worth, was swift and illuminating:Step 1, find out who is behind the coup. Step 2, try them for sedition. Step 3, execute them.A coup against 63 million Americans, who probably own 90% of the guns in the country, might be a strange and stupid error.We won’t have it, we will stand with our President, and we will hang the traitors.Given the level of hard right support for Trump, I asked an influential Republican operative, who requested anonymity to speak freely, how his party might capitalize on a Trump impeachment. He made four points.First, he noted that even after Watergate and Gerald Ford’s pardon of Nixon, Ford almost got elected in 1976 and that polls suggested that with a little more time, he would have beaten Carter. His point was that a president’s impeachment is not fatal to a party’s prospects.His second point was that even if some Republicans were complicit in a Trump impeachment, the party would need to maintain that Trump “was railroaded by the Democrats, not the Republicans” in order to preserve party unity.Third, if impeachment becomes a likely prospect, Republicans of all stripes should start reinforcing Mike Pence’s image as legitimately presidential.Fourth, he argued that Democrats would be foolish to push impeachment:The Democrats want Trump in there, kicking, screaming and dragging it out as long as possible. Trump is the gift that keeps on giving.The accompanying graphic, which first came to my attention when a version of it was published on May 21 by Charles Franklin, a professor of law and public policy at Marquette University, demonstrates the continuing strength of Republican support for Trump. The graphic, based on Gallup poll data, shows low levels of Trump approval among Democrats and independents — from roughly 3 to 23 percent — climbing to more than 70 percent among liberal-to-moderate Republicans, and surging to 90 percent among conservative Republicans.When one third of the electorate holds a politician in such high esteem as Republicans hold Trump, forcing the president out of office through impeachment, application of the 25th Amendment or some other untested procedure, invites unpredictable political repercussions.To talk about these repercussions, I called Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who has worked for many presidential and senate candidates.Castellanos declared:The country will not impeach Donald Trump because the alternative is you, the alternative is me, the alternative is the Washington establishment that failed the country. The voters see the Washington establishment as an abusive husband who has beaten the crap out of them for decades.If Congress were to impeach Trump, “we would have to carve in stone over the entrance to the Capitol ‘Abandon all hope ye who enter here’.”Castellanos went on to make a point that goes to the heart of the danger of impeachment. Not only would impeachment serve to sharpen the anger of the right-wing populists who turned out in droves last year, but it would mark a failure to address the grievances that produced Trump’s victory:The little people need Trump to protect them from the establishment, their predator. Tell me when the establishment has learned anything, said they are sorry, said they are going to change. Until that happens, the little people have no place else to go."
26,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/impeachment-trump.html,"To clarify: The House Judiciary Committee has begun an inquiry to determine whether to recommend the impeachment of President Trump. The effort has been underway since March 4, when the committee announced it would look into “the alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power” on the part of the president. Last Thursday, committee members passed a resolution setting the parameters for the investigation “to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” On Tuesday, the panel began what its chairman, Representative Jerry Nadler, has said will be an “aggressive series of hearings” to this end.This does not mean that the committee will necessarily recommend impeachment. But Mr. Nadler’s team is working to establish whether that step makes sense. Unfortunately, there is tremendous confusion about what the Judiciary Committee is up to — largely because of conflicting signals from House Democrats, who have been struggling with their public statements on impeachment. Mr. Nadler has said repeatedly that his committee is engaged in an impeachment investigation — or, if you prefer, an impeachment inquiry. He insists the “nomenclature” does not matter. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and her leadership team clearly disagree. They assiduously avoid the “I” word, painting the committee’s work as garden-variety oversight.As a result, even Democratic lawmakers don’t seem to know whether they are engaged in an impeachment inquiry. Representative Pramila Jayapal has said “yes.” Representative Jim Himes has said “no.” Last week, Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, said “no” — then backtracked, claimed he’d misheard the question and offered a non-answer instead.This is more than semantic hairsplitting. It is a reflection of the Democrats’ divisions over the wisdom of impeaching Mr. Trump. Advocates of impeachment are eager to play up, and skeptics to play down, the possibility of the Judiciary Committee’s work leading in that direction. Need to Impeach, the advocacy group founded by the Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, called Thursday’s resolution vote a “pivotal moment.” The speaker’s camp characterized it as non-news. At her Thursday news conference, Ms. Pelosi bristled when reporters pressed her on whether an impeachment investigation was underway. The conference was “gathering facts” as it had been doing for months and would make a decision “when we’re ready,” she said. “That’s all I have to say about this subject.”Complicating matters, in attempting to wrest documents and testimony from a White House committed to stonewalling, Democrats have argued in court filings that they are already engaged in an impeachment inquiry. (Some legal experts contend that impeachment proceedings — versus ordinary investigations — could strengthen Democrats’ hand in such scuffles.) So even as the leadership and other skeptics insist there’s nothing unusual going on, Democrats’ court filings cite an existing impeachment inquiry.Republicans have waded into the mix, arguing that impeachment investigations of past presidents required an authorization vote by the full House. Democrats counter that the rules have been changed such that the committee already possesses the investigatory powers that authorization once conferred, making a vote unnecessary.You can see why people might be confused.But the muddled messages are creating their own problems and threatening to undermine the push for presidential accountability. The contradictory statements make Democrats look divided and conflicted, complicating efforts to build public confidence in their oversight powers. Representative Tom McClintock, a Republican, has mocked the Democrats’ strategy as, “You can have your impeachment and deny it, too.”More concretely, the Department of Justice is using Democrats’ ambiguity to argue that the administration need not hand over information sought by congressional investigators. “Most prominently, the speaker of the House has been emphatic that the investigation is not a true impeachment proceeding,” the department contended in a court brief filed Friday.The Democratic leadership should try to find a way forward that, at the very least, doesn’t leave members contradicting one another and further embolden Mr. Trump. Consider having members defer on the question to Mr. Nadler’s committee, which can reply, truthfully, that the panel is uncovering the facts and will decide how to proceed based on those facts. As the Judiciary Committee’s hearings begin, fresh attention will fall on its investigation. This exercise is about more than politics; it is about safeguarding the health of our democracy. Democrats need to clarify to the public — and to themselves — where they are headed.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

27,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/nyregion/zeldin-trump-january-6th.html,"On the day the U.S. Capitol was ransacked, as stunned lawmakers emerged from hiding and police officers were still counting the injured, Representative Lee Zeldin of New York walked into the Rotunda, held up a shaky camera and went live on Fox News.Other Republican leaders had already begun distancing the party from President Donald J. Trump, whose monthslong campaign to overturn his election loss helped incite the violence. But that evening, Mr. Zeldin sounded all but ready to exonerate him.“This isn’t just about the president of the United States,” he said, referring to what prompted the riot that he condemned. “This is about people on the left and their double standards.”The comments — blaming Democrats and “rogue state actors,” not Mr. Trump, for undermining confidence in the election — drew little attention at the time. Soon after, Mr. Zeldin would join 146 other Republicans in seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in key states.Two years later, though, as Mr. Zeldin seeks to become governor of New York, the episode has come to illustrate what may be his greatest political liability: a well-documented, yearslong alliance with a former president many New Yorkers consider a pariah.Mr. Zeldin, a conservative from Long Island, is far from the only or the most extreme Trump acolyte running a competitive midterm race who has helped to sow doubts about the 2020 election.But there is perhaps no other major candidate as deeply associated with Mr. Trump and his campaign of election lies who is seriously contesting a state that has so thoroughly rejected the former president.Mr. Zeldin, 42, was among the first congressmen to treat Mr. Trump’s bid for president with credibility, praising his foreign policy 14 months before the 2016 election. He defended Mr. Trump when fellow Republicans accused him of racism. He volunteered to help lead the president’s impeachment defense. And after the president left office, he voted to block the creation of an independent commission to investigate Jan. 6.The relationship came with clear payoffs that helped build Mr. Zeldin’s profile ahead of a run against Gov. Kathy Hochul, the Democratic incumbent. Records assembled by The New York Times show a sharp uptick in Mr. Zeldin’s appearances on Fox News, where conservative stars are made and grass-roots donations are seeded. Mr. Trump gave him a prime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention. And a coterie of former presidential aides and relatives helped woo big donors.ImageAs president, Donald Trump made several visits to Long Island, including a trip in 2018, where he was often accompanied by Mr. Zeldin at news conferences or fund-raisers.Credit...Pablo Martinez Monsivai/Associated PressNow, to succeed statewide in New York, where voters rejected Mr. Trump by 23 points in 2020, Mr. Zeldin needs swing voters to look past all of that, and embrace a campaign message that emphasizes painful inflation and fears about public safety.Mr. Zeldin may be having some success. A pair of polls released on Tuesday indicated that he was winning independent and suburban voters. But given Democrats’ vast registration advantage, Ms. Hochul still maintained a lead of 11 points in one poll and four in the other.The governor has made the Trump-Zeldin relationship a centerpiece of her campaign, spending millions of dollars on ads trying to tie her opponent to Mr. Trump’s “extreme and dangerous” agenda.That strategy has made some Republicans anxious that it could undercut their best shot at the governor’s mansion in two decades.“Embracing Trump. Not a winning strategy,” George E. Pataki, the state’s last Republican governor, told The New York Post after Mr. Zeldin turned to Mr. Trump for help raising money and floated a possible campaign appearance earlier this fall.Mr. Zeldin appears to have gotten the message — to an extent.His stump speeches usually start and end with rising crime and rising costs, avoiding presidential politics. And after Mr. Trump gave Mr. Zeldin “my Complete & Total Endorsement” in a post on his social media site on Sunday, the congressman told journalists it was not really news.In a sit-down interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. Zeldin called Mr. Biden’s victory legitimate, sought to minimize his role around Jan. 6 and insisted that voters would not be concerned about a former officeholder.“We will defeat Kathy Hochul on Tuesday, Nov. 8, because of the obsession she and the Democratic Party have with the former president,” Mr. Zeldin said. “I’m obsessing over reversing attacks on safety, wallets, freedom and education.”But Mr. Zeldin’s pivot has only gone so far. He has pointedly declined to directly criticize or denounce Mr. Trump.Political analysts said the awkward middle ground reflected Mr. Zeldin’s challenges in assembling a winning coalition. Doing more would risk attracting Mr. Trump’s ire and potentially depress Republican turnout.“You’re in for a penny, in for a pound,” said Christina Greer, a Fordham University political scientist who said the association could still do Mr. Zeldin more help than harm. “He’s running the calculus: Who’s turning out?”But there may be another, simpler impediment: Almost a decade of history, recorded in media interviews, social media posts and votes, makes it hard to obscure the political bond.The alliance stretches back to Mr. Zeldin’s first successful campaign for Congress in 2014, when the New York real estate developer cut him two $1,000 checks and promoted him in a robocall. “Nobody better,” Mr. Trump said on the call. “Very conservative.”When Mr. Trump’s entrance into the political arena began roiling Republican politics, Mr. Zeldin quickly grasped his potential: “Americans want candid, brutally honest, sometimes politically incorrect leadership,” he told ABC News in September 2015.He also showed early on that he was willing to overlook Mr. Trump’s flaws, and echo his tactics. The following June, Mr. Trump accused a Mexican American judge of bias because of his heritage. Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker then, called it “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”Mr. Zeldin, who by then had endorsed Mr. Trump, tried to turn the accusation onto Democrats.“You can easily argue that the president of the United States is a racist with his policies and his rhetoric,” he said on CNN, referring to then-President Barack Obama.But it was not until late 2019, after House Democrats began impeaching the president for a political pressure campaign on Ukraine, that Mr. Zeldin actively moved toward Mr. Trump’s inner circle.He began meeting with a small cohort of right-wing bomb throwers, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, to plot a presidential defense strategy. He spent 12-hour days cross-examining diplomats who testified, and raced to television cameras to flay Democrats, with Trumpian flair, as “a joke.”“It was significant,” Mr. Jordan said. “He was willing to put in the time, and he’s a sharp guy. That’s the kind of combination you want.”As a lawyer whose first campaigns tapped into the anger of the conservative Tea Party movement, Mr. Zeldin had long since honed the ability to channel outrage. But Republican and Democratic colleagues alike took notice of his new role, which placed the mostly amicable backbencher at the center of a partisan war.“That was the first time I saw him really becoming active on the Trump issue,” said Peter T. King, a longtime Long Island Republican congressman. “He was pretty aggressive.”His decision-making around Mr. Trump’s drive to overturn the 2020 election may prove more consequential.At nearly every turn, Mr. Zeldin sided with Republicans who were amplifying doubts about its legitimacy. A month after the election, he signed onto a Texas lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to throw out results in key swing states, previewing his Jan. 6 votes.Recently disclosed records show that shortly after the election, Mr. Zeldin worked behind the scenes to pass along ideas to Mr. Meadows, who had become White House chief of staff, about how Mr. Trump could better make his case.According to text messages shared with the House committee investigating Jan. 6, Mr. Zeldin suggested the campaign should “upload vetted voting irregularities (videos, etc) onto one narrowly focused, credible microsite with a donation link for the Presidents legal fund for all of us to reference” and appoint a single spokesman dedicated to giving public daily updates cataloging legal actions and alleged irregularities.“On it,” Mr. Meadows replied.But Mr. Zeldin does not appear to have joined a series of meetings and calls among allies to plot how to keep Mr. Trump in office, actions that have entangled some congressional colleagues in high-profile investigations.Rather than repeating Mr. Trump’s more outlandish theories, Mr. Zeldin, in public statements and a speech on Jan. 6, focused on elevating concerns about “unlawful and unconstitutional” changes to election procedures in battleground states Mr. Biden had won.At the time, many Republican officials saw drawing such distinctions as a way of remaining roughly factual — election procedures were changed in many states to make voting easier during the pandemic — without alienating Mr. Trump. The distinction was lost on many average supporters.“I wasn’t interested in trying to talk any sense into anyone who has the hardened position that this was the first perfect election,” Mr. Zeldin said in the interview. “And I had no interest spending that time either trying to convince the person who believed that absolutely any allegation of fraud that gets made is just true.”Still, Mr. Zeldin rejected the idea Mr. Trump was to blame for any of the violence, which he condemned anew.“People can have their conspiracy theories and say, ‘I know Donald Trump better than you do, and I believe what Donald Trump wanted was exactly what happened with all the violence,’” he said. “I don’t believe that.”Kirsten Noyes contributed research and Luke Broadwater and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting."
28,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/opinion/how-not-to-impeach.html,"WORCESTER, Mass. — With Democratic control of Congress after 2018 increasingly plausible, those who most intensely seek the impeachment of President Trump are organizing, agitating — and conducting a veritable clinic in how not to exercise one of the Constitution’s most solemn powers.Investigations are still underway, but 58 House Democrats have already voted to consider impeaching Mr. Trump. Tom Steyer, a Democratic megadonor, is running a multipronged campaign calling for Mr. Trump’s impeachment on grounds ranging from his North Korea policy to allegations of obstruction of justice.It is true that impeachment is a political rather than a criminal device, but not like this. It requires the kind of political judgment concerned with the public good, not with gaining electoral advantage. The prudent path forward lies somewhere between “fiat justitia, ruat caelum” and “Vox populi, vox Dei” — “let justice be done though the heavens fall” on one hand and “the voice of the people is the voice of God” on the other.Mr. Trump may well have committed impeachable offenses. Many presidents have. The nature of the office, whose governing rules cannot speak to every exigency, inevitably requires risking oneself in the manner Thomas Jefferson described: “An officer is bound to obey orders; yet he would be a bad one who should do it in cases for which they were not intended, and which involved the most important consequences.”That an offense is impeachable does not mean it warrants impeachment. Congress must account for both the context of the offense and the general political context of the times — such as the potential public reaction to impeachment — which a popular stampede discourages.If Mr. Trump’s actions merit impeachment, the most important task will be persuading many of the considerable number of Americans whose support for the president is apparently immovable to view his removal as necessary for the public good rather than as a coup d’état.Republicans who are scurrying to denounce and delegitimize investigations into Mr. Trump — inquiries that are not yet complete — threaten the converse result: If Mr. Trump is exonerated, those who sought his downfall will be able to say it was the product of political interference.Just as these efforts will give cover to those who have already reached conclusions hostile to Mr. Trump, the current campaign to incite impeachment will make it plausible for his staunch defenders to say any future effort is illegitimate, even if it arises from sober processes. The campaign atmosphere surrounding the calls for impeachment feeds directly into Mr. Trump’s claim that he came to slay the establishment beast, and the beast responded by seeking to destroy him. The taint on an impeachment arising from such a process would be inescapable.The idea of a campaign-style drive for impeachment is also hostile to our constitutional design, which does not require a criminal offense to impeach a president but does feature the trappings of a criminal prosecution. The purpose of those trappings is not simply to protect the rights of the accused but also to establish the process’ legitimacy in the public eye.It mistakes the political nature of impeachment to make it simply susceptible to ordinary political forces. Immediately after declaring impeachment’s availability for political offenses, Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist 65 warns that the “prosecution” of impeachments, “for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.”The constitutional architecture of impeachment is supposed to slow the rush to judgment that might result from these passions. Hamilton called impeachment “a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men,” and the analogy indicates the gravity of the undertaking.The House is designed to be the most direct representative of the people in this regard. If the people want the president impeached, the House will eventually do so. But “eventually” is the key: That body is also designed to register the people’s intense and sustained views without being captive to passing whims.The Senate is supposed to operate at a greater constitutional distance. That is becoming a challenge as the velocity of communications reduces the separation of senators from public opinion and as the House — with the polarization and partisanship it now reflects — becomes a primary feeder to the Senate.All this heightens the demands on those who would participate in a process of impeachment to do so with the sobriety a national inquest requires. It remains unclear both whether Mr. Trump has committed impeachable offenses and whether, if he has, impeachment is a prudent political remedy. What is clear is the imperative for Congress to treat the exploration of those questions with a gravity that will reconcile the public, including Mr. Trump’s base and his most intense critics, to the answers."
29,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/impeachment-briefing-farewell.html,"This newsletter spent a lot of time thinking about the politicians and officials responsible for conducting, participating in and judging the impeachment inquiry and trial. One of those officials, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman — a member of the National Security Council — was escorted from the White House today, most likely as an act of retribution for his testimony.Yet for all of the drama we covered, the plodding path to an acquittal took us right back to where we started, with both sides seeming to hold the same intensity of anger or despair.For our last edition of the Impeachment Briefing, I wanted to think more about how those outside of the political class experienced the story. I talked to three people — an independent voter and two Times columnists with often contrasting views — who tried to help me understand why the country remains divided along familiar lines.How an independent respondedJerry Iannacci is 52. He lives in Newtown Square, Pa., outside Philadelphia, and has taught art classes at a public middle school for 22 years. He grew up in a historically Republican pocket of the state but became a Democrat, voting enthusiastically for Barack Obama.Before the 2016 election, disillusioned with the tensions in American politics, he changed his voter registration to independent. And for the first time in his life, he chose not to vote in the presidential race.“I’m one of those people who maybe swung it Trump’s way,” he told me. “It’s a regret, but it felt like a matter of principle.”But when he watched the impeachment proceedings, Mr. Iannacci — who, as a swing voter in a swing state, represents perhaps the most coveted constituency in American politics — was reminded of the equal-opportunity disgust he has felt.The investigation and trial of President Trump, he said, would be remembered in historical writing but not in what he referred to as our “regular social-political climate,” leaving an otherwise momentous event deprived of immediate meaning.“Impeachment should have been a chance for us to look objectively at what our values are,” he said. Instead, he only grew “more disconnected and disillusioned with the belief that we are exceptional and different.”The almost perfectly split votes to impeach, block new witnesses and acquit the president reflected what felt so broken to Mr. Iannacci.“If it’s your camp, it’s O.K. If it’s the other camp, it’s not O.K.,” he said. “If you’re saying it only matters if the other guy did it, that’s a scary situation for us as a country.”Mr. Iannacci sees a way out: finding a way to convince more voters that the parts of our democratic process that bring stalemate are still worth the effort.“If you start to trivialize this or that, you’re saying only the stuff that matters to you matters,” he said. “Elections matter, impeachment matters. There has to be some group of people way smarter than me that have to figure out how to make that argument work.”What can the polls tell us?Mr. Iannacci’s frustrations are reflected in the polling around impeachment. There was a surprising trend for Mr. Trump: His, and the Republican Party’s, numbers remained steady, and occasionally ticked upward, during the impeachment trial, offering him the sheen of affirmation. According to a FiveThirtyEight polling average, the president’s current approval rating is on the high end of the very narrow range we’ve seen throughout his presidency.I spoke with David Leonhardt, an opinion columnist at The Times who writes about polling, to help me understand what these kinds of trends mean.David, what have the polls told you about how impeachment has affected voters?If aliens landed from outer space and looked at Mr. Trump’s approval ratings, they would never know impeachment had happened. They would never know that anything had happened. They wouldn’t know about his successes — getting judges confirmed, passing the tax cuts — or his failures, like health care or the Mueller investigation. His approval rating has been remarkably solid.Do we as journalists have a mistaken idea of how events influence people?We live in such a polarized country. People have already made up their minds about Donald Trump and the two parties. That’s not completely irrational. If you are in favor of gun rights and against abortion rights, I understand why you wouldn’t change your mind about Donald Trump because of the news of the day. If you want more gun control and you want abortion to be available, the fact that the economy added several hundred thousand jobs in the last few months is not going to suddenly make you like Donald Trump.How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Learn more about our process.The problem with this system is that it can really reduce accountability in politics. People are going to stand by their side even in extreme cases. It happened during Bill Clinton’s impeachment, and we’re living in an even more polarized time now. There is even less room for persuasion than there was back then.Did impeachment end up mattering to people?We don’t know right now. If you looked at the polling, you can say it didn’t matter much. But the only poll that really matters is the election in 2020. Polling also suggests that Americans are somewhat exhausted by the Trump presidency. There are some number of people who don’t hate him but are tired by the chaos. I think it’s too early to know whether this damaged him at all with those people.Throughout impeachment, polling constantly indicated a split of some kind oriented by party, even with slight majorities. The final acquittal vote was almost perfectly party line. Why are we seeing so little gray?Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former White House adviser, has said that we’re not going to hug it out, meaning America is not going to hug out these big issues. There’s a really dark version of that, which is that we have a level of societal conflict that we haven’t had in some time.There’s also some truth in that, whether it’s about the social issues like gun control or abortion, whether it’s about how religious a society we should be or how diverse a society we should be. There are these huge debates, like impeachment, where basically the parties neatly line up on either side of those debates. It is very hard given the stakes and the starkness of the disagreements for any individual news story, even one this big, to move someone.What to make of an age of impunityThe acquittal was another instance of how the biggest stories in the Trump years have eventually concluded without politically fatal consequences.My colleague David Brooks, a longtime opinion columnist here, considered that phenomenon recently. The big news events in our lives, David wrote, “have ceased to drive politics the way they used to. We’ve seen gigantic events like impeachment, the Kavanaugh hearings, the Mueller investigation and the ‘Access Hollywood’ tapes. They come and go and barely leave a trace on the polls, the political landscape or evaluations of Donald Trump.”The organizing principle that can explain the trend, David says, is sociological. “When a whole country sees events through a similar lens, then you don’t have to think a lot about the process people use to make meaning. It’s similar across the land,” he wrote. “But when people in different regions and subcultures have nonoverlapping lenses, the process by which people make sense of events is more important than the event itself.”I asked David about how we — and those we don’t agree with — can think about the cycle of impunity we seem to be in.Both sides walked away from impeachment with similar levels of indignation. What explains that?We started out with the premise that this impeachment trial was like a jury, that people walk in with a blank slate and see the evidence, decide whether there’s a crime and decide whether to convict. But this is happening in the middle of basically a political cold war. The price of convicting someone of your own party is perceived as the essential elimination of the self. It’s perceived as losing the moral war to the other side, as giving in to each other, of giving up your loyalty to sacred ideas.This is the problem with scandal politics. It’s the dark legacy of Watergate: When Richard Nixon fell, you realized you didn’t have to defeat your opponent in the ballot box. You could destroy him through scandal. It was easier and more morally satisfying. It also fed the fantasy that infects our politics that you can make the other 42 percent of the country go away.But did Democrats have a case?They did. The president was absolutely guilty. If I had been a senator, I would have voted to convict and remove him from office. But where I fault the Democrats is that there was never any chance of that. If you’re like myself and think he shouldn’t be president, you have to notice that his approval ratings are up and that the G.O.P. is popular. The reactions by the two sides are remarkably similar to the Clinton impeachment. There’s something about the country that just doesn’t like this process.How much of this is about how the journalists communicate the news? In our pages and on TV, for example.A story on social mobility in Idaho isn’t grabby. Something about cable likes the soap opera of the unfurling of scandal, and the daily adrenaline rush of: “We’re about to get him.” The accumulation of the feeling of nearing defeat. But as we’ve seen in these big stories in the Trump years, the defeat doesn’t arrive.You wrote that “ideological polarization is not on the rise, emotional polarization is on the rise. We don’t necessarily disagree more. We perceive our opponents to be more menacing.” That felt like the theme of the president’s news conference yesterday: The enemy is never thy friend.It’s two things: negative polarization, that politics is the organization of hatred. The second effect is affective polarization. It’s all emotional, especially when we’re in scandal mode. It’s not about how craft an infrastructure plan, which is a boring, practical question. It becomes a moral war for recognition.Nancy Pelosi understood this before impeachment got started, that each team needed to police its own side. And if each team was unwilling to do it, then the other side trying to police it would make everything worse. That lack of policing our side, on the conservative side — that started with the first Republican primary debate in 2015.What do we take away from the last four months?Progressives think that the basic norms of our democracy have to be enforced. And I think that’s an extremely fair point.Signing offIt’s been an immense pleasure writing this newsletter every weekday for four months. There was always something to explore and think about, even on days without as much news, and I’m grateful to my many wonderful colleagues who helped me and you organize and grasp what we were seeing on Capitol Hill and in the White House. This story stretched across practically every desk in the newsroom.We received tens of thousands of emails from you describing your reactions to the impeachment saga. The notes that felt especially important were from those who said they had young children, or long days in classrooms, that prevented them from staying on top of the news. I hope this newsletter was informative to the end.If you’d like to continue reading New York Times newsletters, I recommend subscribing to “On Politics,” a smart daily snapshot of American politics that will help you keep up with an increasingly busy campaign season.Thank you for reading us."
